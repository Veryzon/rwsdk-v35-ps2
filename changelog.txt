22/04/03 3ds max and Maya Exporters
  Added Japanese specific behaviour and text to the exception handler.

17/04/03 RpPrtStd (BZ#4623)
  Fixed property table's refcount not incremented correctly after reading.

17/04/03 RtTOC (BZ#4652) 
  RtTOC stream read functions were doing endian conversion twice which
  would've resulted in incorrect TOC data on big endian machines.

17/04/03 RtTOC (BZ#4648) 
  RtTOC stream writing could previously have crashed in the case of a
  failure to write data into the given stream. The function will now
  correctly return a NULL result

16/04/03 OpenGL toon (BZ#4688)
  Toon pipelines did not contain the correct plugin Id.

15/04/03 Exporters
  Fixed problem that could lead to "Unable to set object frame to:" messages
  and aborted exports when exporting Static World assets with the 3ds max
  or Maya scene start time set to > 0.

15/04/03 PS2 RpPDS (BZ#4463)
  rwPDS_G3_Toon_MatPipeID pipeline now sets GS_ZBUF_2 register

15/04/03 (BZ#4501) Maya Particle Emitter interface bug (3.5)

  to a minimum of 0.0.

14/04/03 PS2 Examples
  Updated vcproj example projects to build properly.

13/04/03 RF3 Export
  Fixed bug introduced on 03/04/03. When exporting animated hierarchy assets
  with animation children the animated hierarchy asset is no longer incorrectly
  disabled.

11/04/03 Maya Exporter- Fixed a bug in auto create code.
  There was uninitialized variable that could lead to auto create code

  copied to FMSS. This includes platforms and exporter APIs

10/04/03 (build) Xbox compiler has changed with the new XDK, so the libs etc are
  built with RWCOMPILER=xbox. Only the nullxbox libs are built with RWCOMPILER=net

10/04/03 Build tool (BZ#4590)
  The cwsky compiler was incorrectly reporting error contexts since there
  was no compiler context resource set up, and the build tool was using the
  default search term 'error' which occurred as part of the compiler options.

  Solution was to add a specific cwsky compiler context resource.
  Further information has been added to the documentation regarding this
  problem and solution.

09/04/03 PS2 (BZ#4560)
  Fixed a bug in the material effects pipelines where filling the dma
  unreference array would close the dma buffer before the packet had
  been completely written.

09/04/03 (build) cygwin1.dll updated to match dev version, to avoid 
  compatibility problems when building active and dev branches on the 
  same PCs.

08/04/03 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the April 2003 SDK (#5455).

08/04/03 RpPrtStd & RpPrtAdv
  Fixed emitter copy. Destination properties no longer needs to be in the same
  offset location as in the src.
  Fixed texture step copy. Some pointers were not reset to the dest emitter and

  Fixed texture's ref count not updated during copy.

07/04/03 PS2 (BZ#4524)
  Fixed colour clamping in the G3x_ADLClone pipeline

31/03/03 Xbox (BZ#4511) Skin Toon plugin now supports lees than 4 weights per vertex.

31/03/03 RpPrtAdv
  Fixed memory trampling when reading in old particle files. Some properties
  were not correctly adjusted to the new size.

28/03/03 RF3 Export
  A bug that meant asset names could sometimes be changed when exported to
  RF3 files has been fixed. The fix involves changes to the RF3 format and
  the RwMI layer so the RF3 and RwComm version numbers have been incremented.

28/03/03 RpPrtStd & RpPrtAdv (BZ #4441)
  Fixed caching of property tables during property offset query. The
  property table pointers are reset to NULL if the property table
  are destroyed.
  Fixed memory leak in RpPrtAdv. Ref count was not decremented.

28/03/03 rptoon makefile (null builds only)
  Previously forced usage of multithreaded .dll for null builds. This
  is unnecessary for non-dll builds and causes warnings and possible
  c-runtime library conflicts. It's no longer necessary for .dll
  builds and so has been removed.

28/03/03 2dviewer
  Up-transitions of button pushes weren't being relayed for button
  push enabled builds. (Enable with WITH_BUTTONS in the main.c)

28/03/03 rt2d font loading
  Added stealth functions to all allow access to global font dictionary
  _rt2dFontDictionaryAddFont and _rt2dFontDictionaryRemoveFont

27/03/03 RpPrtStd (BZ #4361)
  Fixed incorrect bounding sphere calculation.

26/03/03 PS2 Visualizer / Instancer workaround for occaisional PS2 lockup
  while remote instancing

26/03/03 PS2 Visualizer updated to use 2.7.0 /usr

26/03/03 PS2 IOP rebooting reinstated
  Visualizer once more can be used on dev tools with non-matching flash

25/03/03 GCN Compressed vertex positions and world sectors.
  When using compressed vertex formats for positions in worlds the world
  sectors positions will now be treated as though they are relative to the
  infimum vertex of the world sectors tight bounding box. This allows large
  worlds to use compressed vertex positions with out running out of range.

25/03/03 PS2 (BZ#4437) - user set alpha blending being overwritten by 
  instancing.
  RpPTankAtomicSkyRenderStateSet now unset rpPTANKIFLAGALPHABLENDING in the 
  instance flags.

24/03/03 (build) modifying api-refs to exclude normmap, for any platform
  except xbox.

24/03/03 rt2d basic font dictionary functionality
  Added _rt2dFontDictionaryAddFont and _rt2dFontDictionaryRemoveFont
  stealth functions.

24/03/03 (BZ#4104) Maestro lighting problems.
  Changed lithing callbacks to not attach non ambient lights if the 
  atomic does not have normals.

24/03/03 PS2 build Machine
  Now builds against SCE 2.7.0 libs

24/03/03 PS2 (BZ#4423) Team pipelines.
  Fixed all gloss environment map pipelines (GEM) to correctly setup the 
  palette for the environment map pass.

21/03/03 Rt2d font reading
  Increased the size of the read buffer to 2560 characters from 256 to

21/03/03 (build) changing makefile.sky to include .i pds files.

20/03/03 RpPrtAdv & RpPrtStd
  Fixed problem with multiple properties in prtadv. It is now possible to
  have several property tables which have the same set of properties but
  different number of frames in the multi frame props. 
  Added new API
    RpPrtStdPropTabGetByProperties
    RpPrtStdEClassGetByPropTab
    RpPrtStdPClassGetByPropTab

20/03/03 Exporter Licensing Problems
  Fixed an issue where it was possible to find an incorrect version of the
  licensing dll on the path prior to the one installed by RenderWare. This
  could cause the exporters to fail to request a valid license. We now
  explicitly load the installed dll instead of relying upon the path being
  setup.

20/03/03 RtBMP 32 bit support
  Added support for loading 32 bit RGB color BMPs, it's unclear
  whether these are valid in the BMP format without extended Bitmap headers
  specifying bit masks. However support was implemented by fixing
  a hard coded 3 byte per pixel scanline malloc which also has the benefit
  of reducing memory overhead for 4 and 8 bit Bitmap reading.

19/03/03 Rt2d & RpPDS
  Fixed incorrect typecast.

18/03/03 Rt2d
  Fixed font handling for unicode > 7FFF on PS2.

18/03/03 GCN ptank
  Fixed SN build errors.

18/03/03 GCN (BZ#4336)
  Single weight toon shaded geometry is now supported.

18/03/03 Removed &apos; delimiter conversion when saving rf3 files.

18/03/03 Max Exporter - When converting old batch nodes, if we detect a physique
modifier in the hierarchy, we turn on the optimize hierarchy option, for back
compatibility with the old Max exporter behaviour: In 3.4, the Max exporter removed
all physique dummy nodes by default. Note that the optimize hierarchy option will
try to remove more nodes, than just the dummy ones.

18/03/03 Xbox (BZ#4351) PTank requires a frame, fixed.

18/03/03 Maestro
  Fixed a problem whereby undisplayed sprite animations could run in the
  background, possibly influencing the sequencing of foreground animations

18/03/03 (build) fix for packaging task empty set problem

17/03/03 OpenGL NVIDIA Vertex Array Range 2 initialization (BZ#4356)
  The GL_VERTEX_ARRAY_RANGE_WITHOUT_FLUSH_NV client state token should be
  enabled/disabled within the GL_VERTEX_ARRAY_RANGE_NV state rather than
  exclusively to it.

17/03/03 Visualizer - fixed 'No RpHAnim Matrices' set bug (BZ#4199)

14/03/03 PS2 Fixed RpADC streaming code to not stream out ADC bits if the
  geometry or world sector is instanced. Correctly align streams to RwUInt32
  alignment.

14/03/03 RpPrtStd
  Check for num of particles > 0 before creating a new batch.

14/03/03
  Removed the API function RtWorldImportGetNumMaterials from rtimport.

14/03/03
  Renamed 'LONG_PTR' type in win_util.cpp to 'long' to fix the Game Cube build.

14/03/03 Rt2d
  Fixed unifont handling for Unicode > 7FFF

13/03/03 RpWorldCreate 0-size mallocs removed (BZ#4245)

13/03/03 Xbox (BZ#4234)
  Controller 1 ignored if there was another controller in port 3 or 4, fixed.

13/03/03 OpenGL RwRasterClearRect BZ#4320
  Fixed an issue that would repeat the cleared rectangle across the raster in some
  cases.

13/03/03 png loading bugfix (BZ#4309)
  pngs specifying a greater palette size than the bit depth allowed were crashing
  the png read function. Fixed.

13/03/03 D3D8 (BZ#4242) Added support for non-pow2 textures if not using mipmapping.

12/03/03 PS2 Fixed bug in using environment map coefficient whilst rendering in the
  environment mapping (Gem) ambient and 4 directional lighting (A4D) pipelines.

12/03/03 3ds max Exporter - Max script functions.
  A new interface with three functions is added. They are:
	RenderWare_Exporter.AssetMgr.CreateAsset();
	RenderWare_Exporter.AssetMgr.AutoCreateAssets();
	RenderWare_Exporter.AssetMgr.SetCustomizedAssets(bool bCustomized);
  The first function works with selection and returns new asset object. If nothing
  is selected Static World asset is created. You can query object properties with:
	objAsset=RenderWare_Exporter.AssetMgr.CreateAsset()
	showProperties objAsset
  The second function will analyse the entire scene and create the assets.
  The third function will set the Customized flag. If set to true, users are
  responsible for managing asset, where if set to false, assets will be recreated
  automatically on each export.

12/03/03 OpenGL RwOpenGLVASetPosition(ATI) (BZ#4310)
  RwOpenGLVASetPosition and RwOpenGLVASetPositionATI did not update the
  client state cache when called, causing redundant calls to glEnableClientState.

11/03/03 RtWing - Fix bug in RtWingFaceForAllFaces.

11/03/02 Exporters - Fixed a bug in the filter top level keys action.

11/03/02 Exporters - Fixed polygon corruption bug, when exporting multiple
  objects, that contain an empty mesh.

10/03/02 Exporters - Fixed version string in Export Manager resource file.

10/03/02 Exporters - In the Dff exporter, before inserting an extra root frame, 
  don't just check the skin export option, but check if the hierarchy is
  actually skinned.

10/03/02 GCC unused attribute
  Correctly placed __RWUNUSED__ in various header files.

07/03/03 OpenGL display list prelight + material color modulation (BZ#4273)
  Modulated color values were incorrect for display list instancing.

07/03/03 Rt2d
  Bug fix. Fixed incorrect setting of UNICODE flag during reading.

05/03/03 Xbox MatFX added runtime checks to remove problems when a material
  uses envmap or bumpenvmap without providing an envmap texture.

04/03/03 XBox (BZ#4244)
  The driver now sets automatically the required renderstates for antialiasing.

04/03/03 PS2 Multipass rendering. Fixed bug with NULL texture causing subsequent
  textured meshes to be incorrectly rendered. (BZ#3147)

04/03/03 OpenGL NVIDIA vertex array range & remapped vertex data (BZ#4222)
  Atomics that have numIndices < numVertices can now be remapped at instance
  to reduce the number of vertices in vertex arrays. Display lists do not
  support remapping.

  NVIDIA vertex array range (VAR) memory manager updated to dynamically adjust
  the VAR pool size if heavy use of dynamic vertex arrays is detected.

28/02/03 GCN (BZ#4233)
  In a rare case the Async rendering code could wake a thread before it was slept
  causeing the ASync rendering code to lockup.

27/02/03 RtLtMap
  Fixed segv from reloading a lightmap world and regenerating the lightmaps.

25/02/03 22:00:00 RW3.5 Release point.

24/02/03 XBox visualizer
  Corrected controller drift problem (BZ#4137)

24/02/03 PS2 DebugStation Visualizer
  Now spins down DVD after loading Visualizer

20/02/03 RpPatchMesh streaming. (BZ#2994)
  RpPatchMesh stream write now wraps the patch mesh in a rwID_PATCHMESH chunk.
  Hence when streaming in an RpPatchMesh with RpPatchMeshStreamRead the 
  rwID_PATCHMESH must be found first. If old functionality is required use
  the stealth function _rpPatchMeshStreamReadNoChunk.

20/02/03 RpPTank
  All platforms: fixed 2d and matrix particle rotation to correctly calculate
  particle orientation with respect to up vector being 0 degrees.
  GCN: fixed constant centre offset to machine the offset space of the generic
  platform.

19/02/03 PS2 PS2All
  Modified RpMeshPS2AllSyncTextureUpload to always enable or disable alpha
  test. Hence also modified RpMeshPS2AllTextureStateUpload to always set
  the GS_TEST_1 register.

19/02/03 GCN
  Changed dlFwrite to return the number of items written.

19/02/03 Exporters - Removed bounding box influence on the exported world.
  The RtImportWorld now calcualtes its own bounding box, according to the
  given geometry, and igonres the bounding box of the exported scene. In 3.4,
  exporting a sub set of the world, would result in a big bounding box binding
  the entire scene. In 3.5, only the sub set's box is calculated.

19/02/03 RenderWare mesh building
  Changed the way in which triangle data is sorted for mesh building. This
  previously involved some sorting based on pointer address meaning that
  matching vertex and triangle input data didn't guarantee the same output.
  This has now been resolved.

19/02/03 Xbox build machine using February 2003 XDK with Integrated Hotfixes (#5344.2).

18/02/03 GCN
  Fixed asserts in RpGeometryDestroy due to reference count being decremented
  to early.

18/02/03 GCN Patch2
  Build machine upgraded to use GCN_SDK_5-Sept-2002_Patch2.

15/02/03 Rt2d / Maestro - Fixed color tints problem (BZ#3356)
  rt2d's color hierarchical scale/offset has been fixed
  Color tint offsets are now correctly exported by 2dconvrt.

14/02/03 Exporter - RwCommMesh::GetTriangleUserData function is removed.
  Instead you should use GetPrimitiveUserData() and RwExpPrimToTriMap()
  functions.

14/02/03 Memory clean up on stream read failures (BZ#3985 + BZ#3991)
  Fixed some memory leaks when RpClumpStreamRead fails during the streaming
  of a clump.

13/02/03 OpenGL Ptank metrics (BZ#3951)
  NumProcTriangles were showing an incorrect value.

12/02/03 GCN New API functions.
  RxGameCubePreInstanceSetOptimize
  RxGameCubePreInstanceGetOptimize
  RwGameCubeSetFrameLatency
  RwGameCubeSetMinRetraceCount

12/02/03 3ds max Exporter - Scale Keys now extracted from PRS controllers
  The RwMaxPRSControlCreator::TraverseControllers function now builds
  animations from the scale sub controller. If you have used large numbers
  of scale only keys this could lead to redundant keyframes being exported so
  we recommend removing unnecessary scale keys.

12/02/03 PowerPipe BZ#3371
  Fixed bug in calculating node index in RxPipelineFindNodeByName

12/02/03 Maya Material Alpha. 
  Previously (3.4) The Alpha value for a Maya material
  was taken from the Alpha gain value of any diffuse colour texture map. 
  This is not how the material alpha works in the Maya viewport. Have changed
  Maya materials to always take the alpha value of the base material colour. 
  The Exporter will display a warning message if any diffuse texture with non 
  standard (1.0) Alpha Gain is detected. 
    
11/02/03 3ds max Exporter - RwMaterial and Render To Texture (RTT)
  All the images rendered from the RTT for object with RwMaterial, were black.
  This is now fixed for all render elements except complete and specular maps.
  Currently diffuse map renders only unshaded and normal map doesn't include
  the RwMaterial bump map perturbations.

11/02/03 Xbox build machine upgraded to use .Net compiler and February 2003 SDK (#5344).

11/02/03 RtLtMap (BZ#3955)
  RtLtMap now depends on RpRandom. All calls to rand have been replaced with
  calls to RpRandom.

11/02/03 Instance
  Skin-splitting is now done in the custom instancers. This assumes reasonable
  defaults for each platform, but source is provided so you may modify these
  if desired.

11/02/03 RpLtMap & RtLtMap
  Redone lightmap supersampling slightly. Supersampling is now selected during
  illumination with RtLtMapIlluminate, rather than during creation stage with
  RtLtMapLightMapsCreation.
  Also removed the tmp image per texture to just one tmp image. This image is
  reused for each lightmap to reduce memory usage.

11/02/03 RpPTank BZ#3845
  Fixed a bug which was breaking alpha rendering in PTank release builds.

11/02/03 3ds max Exporter - Custom Attributes
  There was a bug with vertex and face custom attributes exported as our user
  data. Fixed now.

10/02/03 Softras installer now requires that the same build version of 
  RW 3.5 PC exists on the same machine, installed as the same user.

10/02/03 OpenGL MatFX multipass environment map & fog BZ#3926
  If fogging was enabled, multipass environment mapping applied fog in
  both passes.

10/02/03 Softras MCP project files updated (demos, examples, viewers)
  Now requires CodeWarrior 8.3 for Windows.

10/02/03 OpenGL MatFX environment mapping optimization
  Further to the changelog entry on 10/10/02, a further requirement to use the
  multitexturing optimization for environment mapping is that fogging is
  disabled.

08/02/03 Examples - GCond
  Added GCond Example.

07/02/03 GCN
  All CodeWarrior MCP files have been repaired and upgraded to CodeWarrior(R)
  for GAMECUBE, Release 2.0

07/02/03 RtWorldImportParams
  Changed the functionality of RtWorldImportParametersInit. The parameters
  are now owned by the caller and therefore should be static.

07/02/03 RWSView example added
  Illustrates how to load assets from an .rws file into a RenderWare Graphics
  application. The .rws file supplied contains a world, a platform independent
  texture dictionary, two clumps and two animations.

07/02/03 TOC
  RtTOCCreate no longer recurses into complex chunks.

06/02/03 Imshadow example modifications (fixes BZ#3814)
  Changes have been made to the way the imshadow shadow render function decides
  if fading should be enabled. It is now explicitly passed as a parameter rather
  than being implied by a fade distance.

06/02/03 RpLtMap & RtLtMap
  Introduced supersampling to lighmap generations. Sampling can now be done
  at a higher resolution before downsampling to a lower resolution for display.
  The functions, RtLtMapLightMapCreate has been changed to include an extra
  parameter to specify the supersampling value.
  Changed the functionality of the lightmap clearing functions. This previously
  would clear the lightmap display texture and create the lightmap sample
  image. This has been changed to just clearing the lightmap display texture.
  The lightmap sample image is created seperately.

05/02/03 Partition Visualisation
added CreateAssetPartitionObject() API function to the RwExpMgrExportManager
class and CreatePartitionObject( ), RemovePartitionObject( ) API functions to 
RwCommAsset class. All the control of the partition visualization objects in the 
modelling package.

05/02/03 Preinstancing tool
  Can now filter default connections by platform

05/02/03 PS2 Camera textures
  Subrastering of camera textures now works.

04/02/03 RwPlCore
  Added rwLIBRARYWARNVERSION. This marks the version and below that will produce
  warning messages when old binary data are read in. The file is still read in
  but will produce messages to recommend the file be re-exported.

04/02/03 Exporters - Bug fix for exporting toon data.
  There was a bug when exporting bsp toon scene. User specified crease edges were
  not remapped right. Fixed now.

04/02/03 3ds max Exporter - Utility renamed and interface change.
  Our utility in 3ds max is renamed from RenderWare_Batch_Exporter to
  RenderWare_Exporter, so a typical call to it would be like:
  RenderWare_Exporter.Interface.Advanced_Settings()
  Currently exposed functions through this interface are:
  Export, View, Advanced_Settings, Plugin_Information, Help_Reference_Guide,
  Help_Tutorials, Help_Programmer and Tools_BatchExport.

04/02/03 GCN (BZ#3784) lib prefix
  lib prefix removed from SN built libs and makefiles.

03/02/03 Exporters
  Changed UV limiting to allow floating point values.

03/02/03 Win (D3D8 and OpenGL) MCP project files updated (demos, examples, viewers)
  Now requires CodeWarrior 8.3 for Windows.

03/02/03 Tutorial 6 added
  A new tutorial expanding the use of RWS files and TOCs.

31/01/03 GCN pathclibsetjmp
  It is no longer required to patch rtpng.a using pathclibsetjmp when linking
  CodeWarrior built libs with SN.

31/01/03 (BZ#3649) PITexDicts and texture plugin data
  Platform independent texture dictionaries did not stream texture plugin extension
  data.
  The internal format of PItexdicts has been changed to accomodate plugin data. A
  legacy code path for stream reading existing PItexdicts is provided.
  Note that plugins that have extension data in the PItexdicts must now be attached
  before stream reading the PItexdicts.

30/01/03 (BZ#2951) importing sectors in PVSEdit from xml and kd files is different.
removed kd support from PVSEdit since it is not compatible with pvs data.

30/01/03 (BZ#3749) PVSEdit edit->undo option does nothing
Removed the edit menu.

30/01/03 (BZ#2836) PVSEdit doesn't refresh the view immediately
Viewport refresh bug fixed in PVSEdit.

30/01/03 (BZ#3329) Toon Editor does not support RWS files
Toon editor now supports Animated Hierarcy assets and textures from within RWS files.

30/01/03 PS2 New metric
  ExtraPassNumTriangles added to measure the number of extra triangles processed
  by multi-pass rendering. Toon, matfx and lightmap pipelines all support this
  new metric.

30/01/03 RpLtMap and RtLtMap
  Changed the way darkmaps are generated. The darkmap conversion is no longer
  an automatic operation and no longer limited to PlayStation 2 only. Darkmap
  conversion can now be done on a host, PC, for use on a PlayStation 2 without
  requiring a NULLSKY build.
  The lightmap example can now generate and view a lightmap result, convert to
  a darkmap and saved as PI tex dict for used on a PlayStation 2. The output
  texture dictionary now contains both the base textures and the lightmap
  textures.

30/01/03 GCN
  The following code is no longer needed when linking CodeWarrior built
  RenderWare Graphics libraries with SN.

  #if (defined(__SN__))
  RwInt32 __float_nan[]   =   {0x7FFFFFFF};
  RwInt32 __float_huge[]  =   {0x7f800000};
  #endif /* (defined(__SN__)) */

30/01/03 Exporters - Function renaming
  Fallowing functions are renamed from: AddShapeVerticesToRtImportWorld,
  AddShapeFacesToRtImportWorld, to: AddShapeVerticesToRtWorldImport,
  AddShapeFacesToRtWorldImport.

29/01/03 preinstancer (BZ#2111)
  instance now always renames output with platform-specific extension.
  instance now has an option to search for and include textures/anims prior
  to instancing, making it possible to view the instanced file with textures
  and animations on the platform-specific visualizers

29/01/03 Exporter and (BZ#2189)
  Changed the way vertex welding works - it now truly welds polygons, not
  just snap them to a grid. In addition, there are two extra control params
  to say what exactly permits welding.

29/01/03 PS2 MatFX (BZ#3351) Texture uploads.
  In some rare cases the second pass texture was ejecting the first even
  though the texture cache was large enough for both textures.

28/01/03 Exporters - Changes to the RwCommObjCreator
  RwCommObjCreator::Attach() now takes one more parameter, which is
  RwCommCreationData. All derived class will have to be updated.

28/01/03 GCN (BZ#3085)
  NBT generation now works with pre-instanced data.

28/01/03 GCN RwGameCubeSetAlphaCompare
  RwGameCubeSetAlphaCompare API function added for setting alpha compare
  parameters.

28/01/03 GCN GXSetZCompLoc
  Now has an internal function _rwDlRenderStateSetZCompLoc for setting
  GXSetZCompLoc. All calls to GXSetZCompLoc should be changed to use
  _rwDlRenderStateSetZCompLoc in order to keep cache coherency.

28/01/03 GCN GXSetAlphaCompare
  GXSetAlphaCompare in no longer called by any rendering pipelines.

  alphaComp, alphaCompRef0 & alphaCompRef01 have been removed from
  _rwDlStateCache.

28/01/03 (BZ#2111) Instance tool:
  - Instance always renames output extensions to match target platform.
    Previously this was done for .rws files, now all RW files are renamed.

28/01/03 OpenGL: Removal of exposed #defines in rwcore.h
  - COLOUR_SCALAR removed as it was unused
  - rwOGLNEARSCREENZ and rwOGLGLFARSCREENZ moved to internal use only.

28/01/03 GCN Upgraded build machine to use,
  CodeWarrior(R) for GAMECUBE, Release 2.0

28/01/03 GCN Upgraded build machine to use,
  GCN_SDK_5-Sept-2002_Patch1.

27/01/03 (BZ#3706) OpenGL texdicts and non-mipmapped textures
  Non-mipmapped textures in an OpenGL texdict were read in as mipmapped.

27/01/03 PS2 MatFX Changes to second and third pass renderstates.
  New API functions RpMatFXSkyRenderStateSet/Get have been added to allow the
  ALPHA, FOGCOL and TEST register values to be set for environment map, dual
  pass and dual pass uv transform effects. These effects now use the use the
  global z write and z test render states and the clamp and filtering settings
  from the texture.

27/01/03 Removed item: 07/01/03 Win32 skeleton menu FPS limiter

23/01/03 MatFX UVANIM effects renamed to UVTRANSFORM
  rpMATFXEFFECTUVANIM is now rpMATFXEFFECTUVTRANSFORM
  rpMATFXEFFECTDUALUVANIM is now rpMATFXEFFECTDUALUVTRANSFORM
  RpMatFXMaterialSet/GetUVAnimTransforms are now
	RpMatFXMaterialSet/GetUVTransformMatrices

23/01/03 Baseball demo (BZ#3647)
  Crowds changed so that only one crowd (daytime or nighttime) is instanced
  during the lifetime of the demo.

22/01/03 OpenGL environment mapping frame (BZ#3625)
  The envmap was incorrectly positioned.

22/01/03 GCN The environment variable CWFOLDER is no longer used to specify
  the CodeWarrior directory. The registry is now used to find the correct path.
  IF GCNCWFOLDER is defined then this path will be used instead.

22/01/03 GCN The environment variable DOLPHINSDK is no needed to build
  RenderWare graphics for GameCube. All makefiles now use the DOLPHIN_ROOT
  environment variable that is set when installing the DolphinSDK. If
  DOLPHINSDK is defined then this path will be used instead of the one
  specified by DOLPHIN_ROOT.

21/01/03 RwTextureSetMipmapping API Reference
  Updated the API reference to include information about loading textures from
  inside stream read functions.  The behaviour of this API remains unchanged.

21/01/03 GCN BZ#3619 Im2d & pixel accuracy
  Im2d was not correctly calculating the projection matrix leading to triangles
  not hitting the correct pixels.

21/01/03 GCN BZ#3623 Im2D & Scissor rect
  2D Immedaite mode no longer sets the scissor rectangle. It now relies on
  RwCameraBeginUpdate setting it to the rasters rectangle. This allows the user
  to change the scissor rectangle between 2D renders.

21/01/03 PS2 - skeleton - CW
  Added call to CW C++ support code whenever the skeleton is compiled as c++
  and/or when using a product that would need it.

16/01/03 GCN BZ#3403
  Tokens above 0xE000 are now ignored to prevent conflict with the PERF library.

16/01/03 GCN BZ#3287
  When seeking to the end of a file from the start dlFseek would try to
  read 0 bytes from the end of the file causing DVDRead to fail.

16/01/03 NULL target DLL generation
  When building the NULL RenderWare Graphics SDK with RWDLL=1, the compiler is
  now set up to build with the /MD[d] flag (multithreaded DLL).

16/01/03 GCN RwGameCubeMinRetraceCountSet
  RwGameCubeMinRetraceCountSet has been added.

15/01/03 PS2 rwDMA_flipData
  rwDMA_flipData type now has slots for a pair of extra display environments
  used in the same way as the 4 dma pointers

15/01/03 RwCameraForAllClumpsNotInFrustum removed from API
  This somewhat obsolete function has been removed since it has great
  potential for confusion in that it relies on RwCameraForAllClumpsInFrustum
  being called first. Also, its behaviour is simple to reproduce using
  RwCameraForAllClumpsInFrustum to mark clumps in the frustum, and then
  using RpWorldForAllClumps to iterate through all clumps, and acting on those
  that have not been marked.

15/01/03 RpWorldGetOrigin removed from API
  This functionality is no longer required since all worlds generated by
  RenderWare since RenderWare 3.10 have a fixed origin of 0,0,0.

15/01/03 RtLtMap
  Added new functions to select and replace the luminance calculation function
  during texture processing on the PS2.
  The set of new functions and callbacks are
    RtLtMapSkyLumCalcMaxCallBack
    RtLtMapSkyLumCalcSigmaCallBack
    RtLtMapSkySetLumCalcCallBack
    RtLtMapSkyGetLumCalcCallBack

14/01/03 RenderWare Graphics Build Tool - Exporters
  Support to build the exporters have been removed since their build process
  now works through DSPs rather than makefiles.

14/01/03 BZ#3379 - 2D toolkit.
2dString and Scene streaming are now endianess proof.

13/01/03 RtImport geometry conditioning.
  Moved to separate toolkits: rtgeomcond and rtwing.
  This affected RtImport, RtGCond, RtWing, RtBary, exporters, world example,
  sector editor and pvs editor. Directly affected are RtImport's conditioning
  parameters and the way Geometry Conditioning is handled.

10/01/03 GCN RxGameCubeResEntryHeader & RxGameCubeInstanceData

  RxGameCubeResEntryHeader & RxGameCubeInstanceData have been removed and
  replaced with RxGameCubeVertexBuffer & RxGameCubeDisplayList.
  RxGameCubeVertexAttr has been added.

10/01/03 GCN Instance & Pre-instance

  Pre-instancing now takes advantage of an index per attribute and variable
  length attribute arrays.

  Pre-instancing removes degenerate triangles from tristrips.

  The above pre-instancing optimisations work with static and skinned geometry
  only. Geometry with NBTs will currently not be optimized.

  IMPORTANT: The native Pre-instance format has been broken and all pre-instanced
  assets will need to be regenerated.

10/01/03 GCN NBT Generation
  NBT generation now works with compressed vertex formats.

10/01/03 BZ#3382 - BZ#3384 - PTank PS2.
  Default alpha testing mode is now the same as the for the rest of RenderWare
  Added platform specfic functions RpPTankAtomicSkyRenderStateSet
  and RpPTankAtomicSkyRenderStateGet, to access and modify the alpha and the
  test register.

10/01/03 GCN NBT Generation
  Pre-instanced vertex data can now optionally by heavily optimized to remove
  duplicate vertex attributes and degenerate triangles from tri strips.

10/01/03 GCN NBT Generation
  NBT generation now works with compressed vertex formats.

08/01/03 PS2 Skin - BZ#3441
  Pre-instance format updated to store the number of vertices using different
  number of weights. This information is needed by the custom lighting G3x
  skinning pipelines. Any assets rendered with a G3x skinning pipeline will
  need to be reinstanced to correctly render.

08/01/03 BZ#3438 - Max Exporter - potential crash when DFF_HANIMSUBHIERARCHYANIM
  was used conjuction with DFF_FILTERTOPLEVELBIPEDKEYS.

07/01/03 Compressed KeyFrame scheme added for RpHAnim
  RtCmpkey toolkit added to implement a compressed keyframe representing
  matrix animation. This compression scheme works through packing floating
  point values into 16 bit integers and decompressing at runtime. The animation
  data is thus reduced to 60% of the original size.

07/01/03 RtAnim Changes
  Modifications have been made to the RtAnim and RpHAnim plugins allowing for 
  different sized animation vs interpolated keyframes and custom data attached
  to animations.
  This includes the addition of a second keyframe size and so maxKeyframeSize
  variables have been renamed to reflect whether they refer to animation or
  interpolated keyframes.
  Small changes will be necessary in custom keyframe schemes which are
  documented in the RtAnim api ref.

07/01/03 BZ#3777 - RwEngineGetVersion returns RwUInt32 for consistency with
  RwStreamFindChunk

07/01/03 RwTextureRead can now do a user defined search for textures before
  attempting to read them from disk. See RwTextureSetFindCallBack, and
  RwTextureGetFindCallBack. The default callback reproduces the previous
  behaviour which is to search the current texture dictionary if one is
  defined or otherwise search all texture dictionaries in the system.

07/01/03 Win32 skeleton menu FPS limiter
  A common option has been added to all Win32 applications that open the
  skeleton menu system during initialization. This option enables/disables
  the FPS limiter. The default limit is 60 FPS, but this can be changed
  by the application. By default the limiter is DISABLED.
  (OBSOLETE, see 27/01/03 entry)

07/01/03 Cloning atomics with MatFX - BZ#3430
  When cloning cloning an atomic with matfx applied the matfx copy callback
  would also setup the matfx pipes after they had been setup by the atomic clone
  function. This could overwrite things like skin or patch pipes with generic
  matfx pipes when it shouldn't.

06/01/03 The NULL Xbox header now defines NULLXBOX_DRVMODEL_H.
  Previously, the only way of the detecting a NULL Xbox build was checking if
  WIN_OSTYPES_H was defined.

06/01/03 OpenGL Win32 skeleton - BZ#3399
  Alt+Tab task switching was not handled by RenderWare Graphics
  examples.

03/01/03 GCN - BZ#3350
  RwIm2d Immediate mode now applies the sub raster offset.

16/12/02 GCN BZ# 2842
  All pipelines now disable the color channels as well as setting the number
  of channels output to the TEV.

16/12/02 GCN BZ# 3084
  All pipelines now disable unneeded color channels.

16/12/02 GCN BZ# 3083
  Alpha lighting was being enabled with color lighting but never used. All alpha
  lighting is now disabled.

16/12/02 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the December 2002 SDK (#5233).
  IMPORTANT NOTE: This is the last XDK to support Visual Studio 6.

13/12/02 PS2
  If a camera texture raster is created mipmaped and automipmaped, the
  mip stack will be auto generated on RwCameraEndUpdate()

13/12/02 PS2 RpPDS - Added G3x Uva and Dup Uva pipelines.
  Both skinned and static, supporting ADL, A4D and APL lighting.

13/12/02 BZ#3322 - RtLtmap - Lightmap rasters now carry the
  rwRASTERGAMMACORRECTED.
  Note that this flag will be lost in the event of the lightmaps being saved
  in separate files.

12/12/02 PS2
  For SN builds, now use to 2.95.3 as this is default in ProDG 3.0
  Note that their default /usr/local/sce/ee/gcc/ee/include/machine/setjmp.h
  is broken. SN users should recover this from the Sony 2.96 distribution.

12/12/02 RwFrame streaming modifications BZ#2912
  Added support for frame lists to be built from branches of hierarchies.
  This fixes a bug where memory trampling could occur if an RpClumps frame
  had siblings.

11/12/02 GCN PTank
  Code modifications to reduce setup cost and state leakage.

11/12/02 GCN Toon
  Code modifications to reduce setup cost and state leakage.

swapping mangement. Changed RpPTankSkyGetPreviousBuffer to
RpPTankAtomicSkyGetPreviousBuffer.

10/12/02 BZ#3272 - OpenGL Team
  Static shadows were not rendering.

10/12/02 BZ#2424 - Lithmap plugin.
  When loading a lightmap with a format different than the lightmap platform
  default, the plugin won't perform any conversion and just message the user
  with the proposed format.

09/12/02 Examples, Demos
  Adding .net project files for examples and demos for pc & xbox.

06/12/02 BZ#3120 - 2dconvert : 2dconvert could clear the text style record when
  converting some odd text string object.

06/12/02 GCN BZ#3236 Removed hard code renderMode from skeleton so examples
  will work in PAL or NTSC by default.

06/12/02 GCN BZ#3247 Compressed vertex support for normals in RpWorlds was
  broken if using, rpS8 or rpS16 formats.

06/12/02 PrtStd Example
   New example, prtstd2, added to show how custom properties are added to
   RpPrtStd for animating particles.

05/12/02 BZ#2247 - Maetro : when streaming in an rt2d string object, if the
  font is not found, this will be ignored by the maestro wich will keep on
  rendering. Streaming out that kind of object is not supported.

05/12/02 OpenGL vertex arrays and world lighting
  RenderWare Graphics OpenGL vertex array functions have been moved from
  the world into the core library. These have been promoted to API status:

   RwOpenGLVASetPosition, RwOpenGLVASetPositionATI, RwOpenGLVADisablePosition
   RwOpenGLVASetNormal, RwOpenGLVASetNormalATI, RwOpenGLVADisableNormal
   RwOpenGLVASetColor, RwOpenGLVASetColorATI, RwOpenGLVADisableColor
   RwOpenGLVASetTexCoord, RwOpenGLVASetTexCoordATI, RwOpenGLVADisableTexCoord
   RwOpenGLVASetMultiTexCoord, RwOpenGLVASetMultiTexCoordATI

  Also OpenGL world lighting functions have been promoted to API:

   RpOpenGLWorldEnableLighting, RpOpenGLWorldDisableLighting
   RpOpenGLWorldIsLightingEnabled

   RpOpenGLWorldSetMaterialProperties, RpOpenGLWorldDisableColorMaterial

   RpOpenGLWorldEnableNormalize, RpOpenGLWorldDisableNormalize

  The stealth variable _rwOpenGLOpaqueBlack has been removed. This can easily
  be replaced in render callbacks with glColor4f( 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f );

05/12/02 BZ#3112 RpPrtStd : texture refcount was not properly updated when
  destroying a streamed prtstd atomic.

04/12/02 BZ#3189 RpSline
  Changed logic test in RpSplineFindPosition from || to &&

04/12/02 OpenGL texturing
  Added the API function
	RwOpenGLSetTexture
  to bind an RwTexture to OpenGL. This is useful for all-in-one node render
  callbacks.

  Also promoted _rwOpenGLSetActiveTextureUnit and _rwOpenGLGetActiveTextureUnit
  to API status, so they are now RwOpenGLSetActiveTextureUnit and
  RwOpenGLGetActiveTextureUnit.

03/12/02 Maya Exporters
  Check in for fix for multiple sets(shaderingGroups) using same shader bug.

03/12/02 BZ#1558 Visualizer Xbox big patches. The LOD value is clamped at
  runtime to generate less than 65535 vertices per atomic, due to a hardware
  limitation on the maximun number of vertices per DrawIndexedPrimitive call.

03/12/02 BZ#3062 - OpenGL & PI texture dictionaries: rwRASTERFORMATAUTOMIPMAP
  OpenGL texture dictionaries did not save the rwRASTERFORMATAUTOMIPMAP flag.
  This could cause problems upon reading some texture dictionaries. The format
  of OpenGL texture dictionaries has now changed to accomodate this. PC OpenGL
  and Macintosh OpenGL texture dictionaries are now different. Existing
  OpenGL texture dictionaries can still be read.
  PI texture dictionaries also do not store this flag, but now ensure that it
  is not used when creating PS rasters while reading a PI texture dictionary.
  Binary version number incremented to 34004.

03/12/02 BZ#3172 - RtLtmap. Lightmap can now be anysize. Creatubg a Lightmap
  bigger than 512x512 will throw an assert when created as they can slow down
  performances.

03/12/02 BZ#2689 - PS2All. Added assert to RpMeshPS2AllSyncTextureUpload
  and multi pass pipelines if texture upload fails.

03/12/02 BZ#2621 - RpMeshSetTriStripMethod missing see also added.

03/12/02 BZ#3043 - Material stream rights callback added.

03/12/02 BZ#2930 - RwMatrixOptimize now uses identity tolerance.

03/12/02 BZ#2756 - PS2All default material pipeline assert moved to prevent
  bogus asserts.

03/12/02 BZ#3111 - LtMapObjectLightMapRead now check if there is a current
  texture dictionnary before using it.
  Added FULLSCENELIGHTING define, which, when defined, allow a generation
  lightmap for a complete scene rather thanjust what's lie in the camera
  frustrum.

03/12/02 BZ#2846 - PS2 Allow blit from an indexed to a non-indexed texture,
  16- to 32-bit and 32- to 16-bit texture.

03/12/02 BZ#3081 - Potential Floating point/Endianess bug fix in bageomet.c

02/12/02 BZ#2984 Xbox & D3D8 - MatFX bumpmapping and compressed textures:
  only supported if the bumpmap texture is NULL and the base texture has
  the bumpmap encoded into the alpha channel.

02/12/02 BZ#2719 - PS2 PPVU example : a 16 bit constant was used in place of a
  15 bit one, preventing compilation when using SN compiler suite.

02/12/02 BZ#3142 DX8 Clearing the Stencil does not work, fixed.

02/12/02 BZ#2940 : ClmpView and disabling hanim animation
  When HAnim is disabled, but the current clump is Hanimated,
  RpHAnimUpdateHierarchyMatrices is now allways called, allowing clump
  manipulation.

02/12/02 BZ#2700 PS2 skel main loop
  Dropped poll to 5ms as I believe that throttling is still required.

02/12/02 BZ#3093 XBox RwXboxDDSTextureRead can crash without assert, fixed.

28/11/02 PS2 Visualizer
  Update for 2.6.0 Libs.

27/11/02 PS2 Build
  PS2 build machine now builds against sce libs 2.6.0.

26/11/02 BZ#2981 Xbox - Exposed the function RwXboxLightsEnable that
  must be used inside the lighting callbacks.

22/11/02 RpPrtStd & RpPrtAdv
  Renamed structures and functions in RpPrtAdv to reduce its length
  fixed some strange naming.
  Fixed particle texture coords step property. Pointers are not
  allowed in particles since this would break single batch on the PS2.
  Introducing version stamping in emitter streaming to fix file compatibility
  problems after the introduction of 2D rotation.

20/11/02 BZ#2841 - rpLTMAPDEFAULTSLIVERAREATHRESHOLD and

  The RenderWare Graphics extension enumeration may have crashed under
  particular circumstances on some video cards.

13/11/02 Xbox - RwXboxDeviceConfig structure changed to provide full control
  over the device creation parameters.
  Provided the function RwXboxDeviceConfigGetDefaultValues for initializing
  the device config structure with the default values used by RenderWare
  Graphics.

  RwVideoMode extended to support refresh rate and raster format.
  RwVideoModeFlag extended to support platform specific video modes, added:
    PS2  : rwVIDEOMODE_PS2_FSAASHRINKBLIT
           rwVIDEOMODE_PS2_FSAAREADCIRCUIT
    XBox : rwVIDEOMODE_XBOX_WIDESCREEN
           rwVIDEOMODE_XBOX_PROGRESSIVE
           rwVIDEOMODE_XBOX_FIELD
           rwVIDEOMODE_XBOX_10X11PIXELASPECT

12/11/02 BZ#2723 - PS2 Examples
  Fix ps2 example mcps to have correct debug settings.

06/11/02 BZ#2607
  RwEngineInit, memFuncs have been made const.
  RwEngineOpen can not be made const because of internal code design.

06/11/02 BZ#2596
  RwMatrixRotateOneMinusCosineSine was unnecessarily over setting the
  matrix flags too many times.

06/11/02 GCN BZ#2401
  Default mesh rendering in the Team matFX pipeline was not being set up
  correctly.

06/11/02 GCN BZ#2333
  The GXFifoObj pointer stored inside RenderWare Graphics was being set to NULL
  when RwEngineClose was being called. This has now been fixed.

06/11/02 BZ#2570. RpPrtStd and RpPrtAdv.
  Added RpPrtStdEmitterPrt2DRotate and RpPrtStdParticle2DRotate for 2D rotation
  support in particles.
  Removed RpPrtStdEmitterPrtAnimFrame and RpPrtStdParticleAnimFrame from RpPrtStd.
  This is done in RpPrtAdv.

06/11/02 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the November 2002 SDK (#5120).

05/11/02 (build) seperated api-refs from pdf docs, changed top level
  and platform specific makefiles for handling autogenerated pdfs

05/11/02 BZ#2667 : RtPITexD not handling texture addressing properly.
  If U and V texture addressing were different, RtPITexD recorded these
  incorrectly. The fix records each texture addressing mode separately.
  Now, if invalid addressing modes are detected when reading a PI texture
  dictionary RtPITexD handles these by the following:
  1) if both addressing modes are invalid, both are set to rwTEXTUREADDRESSWRAP.
  2) if one is invalid, it is set equal to the other, valid, addressing mode.

05/11/02 BZ#2606 : missing RpHAnimHierarchyGetCurrentAnim
  Added RtAnimInterpolatorGetCurrentAnim
  Added RpHAnimHierarchyGetCurrentAnim

04/11/02 GCN BZ#2207
  RwGameCubeCameraTextureFlush was incorrectly calculating the src rectangle
  for the box filter copy.

01/11/02 PS2 - Added Atomic xyzw cluster instancing for ADC pipelines.

01/11/02 BZ#2608 RpSpline
  Changed logic test in RpSplineFindMatrix from || to &&

31/10/02 PS2 - Added generic and World Sector xyzw cluster for ADC pipelines.

30/10/02 (build) Added automated PDF generation files and config to
  build process, includes an .wsf script and xml doc list.

25/10/02 Maya Exporter - Added place holder for MotionPath Animation. Added
  warnings when using MotionPath and not using Dynamic Keyframe Generation.

25/10/02 Maya Exporter - Fixed an Attribute Editor bug when the AE is embedded
  in the Maya main window.

25/10/02 Exporters - Added guard against animated visibility crashing the
  exporter. A warning is now displayed for affected nodes.

24/10/02 Exporters - Added check against duplicate Tag ID's in a heirarchy.

23/10/02 Maya Exporter - Fixed an infinite loop caused by cross-referenced
  constraint nodes.

21/10/02 Rt2d - Added font read callback functions to allow overriding of
  font sources - see Rt2dFontSetReadCallBack, Rt2dFontCallBackRead and
  Rt2dFontGetReadCallBack.

21/10/02 AppWizard hierarchy bug fix (bug #2344)
  Fixed bug in CRenderWare::_AttachHierarchy() that would return NULL if
  an atomic did not contain a skin, which would incorrectly terminate the
  calling iterator.

21/10/02 MatFX - NEW UV Animation effects.
  Two new effects have been added:
	rpMATFXEFFECTUVANIM
	rpMATFXEFFECTDUALUVANIM
  These are equivalent to a standard single or dual pass but with
  texture coordinate transformations applied. The transforms can be set for
  either effect using RpMatFXMaterialSetUVAnimTransforms and they allow
  scaling, translation, rotation, and shearing of textures. The matfx1
  example has been updated to demonstrate the new effects. Using these
  effects is much more efficient than modifying the texture coordinates
  directly and then re-instancing.

17/10/02 Toon, major internal code modification and restructuring.

17/10/02 Maya Exporter - Integrated maya 4.5 into the build process

16/02/02 bz#2246 Xbox - Fixed a bug on RwXbVertexBufferLockDiscard due to D3D
  internal references checks.

16/10/02 OpenGL display list/vertex array support updates.
  * Now supports the GL_ATI_vertex_array_object extension (VAO) for server-side
    vertex arrays. This is a companion to NVIDIA's GL_NV_vertex_array_range
    extension (VAR).
  * Display lists are now only instanced when neither VAO nor VAR are available
    since these extensions provide better performance in vertex arrays.
  * VAO is not used in skinning nor particles for performance issues. This will
    change when direct mapping to video memory becomes available for VAOs.
  * _rwOpenGLVertexHeapSetSize(), used to set the VAR heap, can now be called
    before RwEngineInit() if required.

15/10/02 3ds max Exporter - Fixed a bug in RwMaterial when the platform extension
  was turned on but the effect file was not specified.

14/10/02 bz#2295 DMorph example - Fixed a bug with second and third lights in main.c

14/10/02 Maya Exporter - Fixed a bug when joint and orientConstraint nodes were
  feeding off each other.

11/10/02 OpenGL miscellaneous updates:
  * Stealth material functions consolidated: _rwOpenGLEnableColorMaterial changed
    to _rwOpenGLSetColorMaterial and merged functionality with glColorMaterial.
    Also added _rwOpenGLLightsSetMaterialProperties to simplify render callbacks
    when lighting is enabled.
  * Render callback code for no-lighting simplified.
  * Normal normalization state caching added to world lighting module.
  * Fast paths to renderstate set/gets for all internal plugins added.

11/10/02 GCN Made RpGameCubeWorldGetVtxFmt & RpGameCubeGeometryGetVtxFmt
  Macros in release builds.

11/10/02 GCN Defined RWALIGN to align.

11/10/02 GCN Added extern "C" around _RwGameCubeTextureExtOffset.

11/10/02 RwV3dTransformPoints & RwV3dTransformVectors are now over loadable in
  the driver without the over head of an additional function call.

11/10/02 GCN Texture extensions in gcn & nullgcn builds are now the same size.

11/10/02 (Bug #2227) OpenGL MatFX dual pass bug.
  If the rpGEOMETRYTEXTURED2 flag is not set, and a dual texture exists, the
  first set of texture coordinates should be reused for the dual texture.
  OpenGL previously always assumed that a second texture coordinate set existed
  and used that.

10/10/02 OpenGL MatFX environment map optimization.
  Added a special case to environment mapping when the shinyness parameter is
  set to 1.0f (or 255). If the GL_ARB_multitexture and GL_ARB_texture_env_combine
  extensions are available, multitexturing can be used here. Otherwise dual
  pass is used. Multitexturing cannot be used generally since there is no
  multiply-add texture combiner.

10/10/02 OpenGL custom instancing function removed for all-in-one nodes.
  This feature was not used and is not necessary. API functions
  RxOpenGLAllInOneSetInstanceFn and RxOpenGLAllInOneGetInstanceFn removed.

10/10/02 (Bug #2190) Fatal nullxbox driver bug, fixed to allocate memory for textures
  as a multiple of 4 bytes.

10/10/02 OpenGL multitexturing and vertex arrays
  Moved the glClientActiveTextureARB call from the multitexture
  vertex array setup to _rwOpenGLSetActiveTextureUnit. Ensures applications using
  custom vertex array setup functions will still work correctly.

08/10/02 (PR#3901) Blinking lights fixed by updating the destination matrix flags:
  * If the source matrix is identity, destination flags are set to identity.
  * If the source matrix is orthonormal, destination flags are set to orthonormal.
  * In any other case the destinations flags are set to zero.

08/10/02 Maya Exporter - Exporting multiple dff or bsp nodes at once to different
  directories was broken. All assets were being placed in the same directory. This
  is now fixed.

08/10/02 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the October 2002 SDK (#5028).

04/10/02 3ds max Exporter - Spline export used to fail if there were other
  batch nodes before it. Fixed now.

03/10/02 Maya Exporter - Fixed the naming problem with files on the network.

03/10/02 API Reference - can now click on folder name to open folder
  Previously you need to select a function name or page to display the
  html page.

03/10/02 (PR#3894) Fixed matrix particles on sky2.
  Frame swapping and querying previous frame buffer did not check for fastpipe
  and thus returning null pointers.
  Also fixeding missing clone callbacks for sky2.

03/10/02 3ds max Exporter - Fixed Auto Create Nodes not to set hanim option
  if there is only morphing or dmorphing

02/10/02 (PR#3893) D3D8 RwEngineGetVideoModeInfo bug, fixed.

01/10/02 API Reference built with 1.2.18-20020927 Doxygen version which fixes
  cross references.

01/10/02 PS2 palette placement
  Fix for palette being placed incorrectly for 256x32 mipmaped textures PR#3891

01/10/02 (PR#3888) Xbox Texture dictionary loading crash. Added support for the old
  binary format.

01/10/02 (PR#3887) Xbox VSHADER example, fixed.

30/09/02 3ds max Exporter - We didn't support target animation for target lights
  and cameras. Fixed now.

30/09/02 RenderWare Graphics Build Tool
  If resources are modified at shutdown, there is now a "cancel" option to return
  to the application.

27/09/02 (PR#3854) RpPrtStd & RpPrtAdv. PrtStd atomics could not be cloned because
  of empty copy functions. Added clone callbacks for all emitter properties, Particles
  and PTank are not copied. Only the emitters.
  Added new API, RpPrtStdEmitterClone.

26/09/02 (PR#3878) Doxygen version reverted back to 1.2.17.

26/09/02 (PR#3884) Xbox RpTeam static shadows, fixed.

25/09/02 Maya Exporter - Fixed texture transformation matrix

25/09/02 Rt2d - Added Unicode support. UNICODE build is no longer necessary.
  Updated docs on how Unicode is supported and enabled.

24/09/02 Exporters - Fixed Ligtmap bug with objects without textures.

20/09/02 3ds max Exporter - We were not enabling the matfx on the world
  sectors when rwmaterials had only xbox or gamecube extencions. Fixed now.

20/09/02 3ds max Exporter - RwCommImage::ConvertToTrueColor() bug
  There was a bug in this function resulting more in corrupted data.
  This function was used only when opacity map was burned into the
  diffuse map which was palletized, so we converted it into the true
  color map. It is fixed now.

20/09/02 (rw-bug #3842) - Rt2d/Maestro - Fixed problem with color offsets
and tints

20/09/02 3ds max Exporter - Self-Illumination was ignored
  It is fixed now.

19/09/02 (Bug No: 1940) Maya and 3ds max particle exporting - The parent scaling
  for the particle emitters is now burned into the emitter size on export. 3ds max
  and Maya are both more WYSIWYG than before; however scenes before this fix, that
  used parent scaling, might need adjusting.

18/09/02 3ds max Exporter - "Export User Property Values (RpUserData)"
  was reset to false for the old scenes in the new exporter. This is fixed
  now, so if you load the old scene option will be set correctly. If you
  resaved the in the meantime since the 3.4 release on 30/08/02 and used
  the option, it will be reset to false, so you'll have to manually set it
  on again. By default this option is off.

17/09/02 3ds max Exporter - "Export User Property Values (RpUserData)"
  option was ignored by the exporter and we always used to export strings
  from the object properties as the user data. Fixed now.

17/09/02 (PR#3851) Xbox team plugin doesn't support re-start, fixed.

17/09/02 OpenGL ambient lighting was modulated with itself.
  Global ambient is still accumulated and modulated with material ambient
  but now GL_LIGHT_MODEL_AMBIENT is set to opaque white.

16/09/02 PS2 Display/DrawBufferRaster
  As part of the preparations for fully custom video modes, the internal
  implementation of RpSkyGetDisplayBufferRaster() & RpSkyGetDrawBufferRaster()
  have changed. RpSkyGetDisplayBufferRaster now works correctly in FSAA0
  modes.

16/09/02 Xbox now built against September 2002 XDK QFE patched to 4928.2.

13/09/02 Exporters - There is a change of behaviour in 3ds max 5 for Assign
  Vertex Colors utility. With default options it will assign prelight color
  per face per vertex and the same vertex when approached from the different
  faces will have different prelight color. This will result in exporter
  duplicating vertices. The real solution is to turn on the "Mix vertex
  colors" option in the utility. We now do the rounding in the exporter
  of the color values to an 0-255 int before remapper which helps, but still
  is not perfect, so we'll display a warning if too many vertices are
  duplicated. Any way the option should be used. We'll also output info on
  the number of vertices duplicated due to normals and uvs differences.

13/09/02 Prtstd example max particle count and softras ptank creation (PR#3838)
  The default maximum particle count in the Prtstd example has been reduced
  from 30,000 to 10,000 since this can cause problems with RpGeometryCreate
  exceeding the maximum number of vertices.
  Softras RpPTank exhibited this problem and will now report an error if the
  maximum particle count is exceeded.

13/09/02 PS2 dma manager
  Added frame rate control (ability to lock to 30, etc) and yield callback to
  allow "wasted" cpu time to be returned to the application, and dma buffer
  usage to be monitored. Added extra FLUSH in Gate to allow for possible
  sync failure.

11/09/02 GCN Upgraded to Dolphin1.0 SDK Sept 2002.

11/09/02 (PR #3827 & PR #3830)
  Fixed Rt2dDeviceSetMetric not working correctly.
  Fixed Rt2dDeviceGetMetric. Was accidently removed from a previous check in.

11/09/02 (PR#3829) Win skeleton windowed mode, updating RsGlobal.maximumWidth
  and RsGlobal.maximumHeight after creating the window.

10/09/02 (PR#3825) GCN Added weight ordering code to skin plugin to prevent
  compressed weights terminating skinning too early.

10/09/02 PS2 texture cache
  The function RpSkyTextureCacheSetState() has been removed.

09/09/02 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the September 2002 SDK (#4928).

09/09/02 (PR#3815) Softras HH API header now included as part of a binary SDK.

03/09/02 (PR#3798) PDS now works with rwENGINEINITNOFREELISTS.

02/09/02 PTank - SKY : Instancing code for fast pipe could
  miss a buffer instance when using multi-buffering displaying flicking in
  visualizer (CL 54798).

02/09/02 ======================================================[80 Characters]==
  Branched to RW34Active.

30/08/02 (PR#3441) RtLineSphereIntersectionTest now takes an extra argument
  to return the distance parameter, rather than this being the return
  value. The return value is now an RwBool, and indicates whether an
  intersection was found. This removes the previous ambiguity of
  a return value of -1.

29/08/02 PrtStd - sky : added support for multi buffering particles
         PrtStd - sky : maximum batch is now automatically updated when too
         big.

29/08/02 3ds max 5 viewport rendering
  3ds max 5 multi texture viewport rendering has been disabled due to
  problems with D3D support changes in 3ds max 5. Single texture viewing
  is still available.

28/08/02 Xbox now built against August 2002 XDK QFE patched to 4831.5

28/08/02 OpenGL MatFX bumpmapping bug fix (PR#3770) - texture coordinates
  in a vertex array were given a bad stride.

27/08/02 Binary version number incremented to 34003.
  Streamed worlds now store the world bounding box rather than it
  being regenerated on load.

27/08/02 Removed RpLight types from baequ.*
  baequ was defining global ints containing RpLight types for use in
  assembler. These are currently unused and have been removed to fix a
  dependency on rpworld when building rwcore or plcore.

23/08/02 GCN Doubled FIFO to prevent submitting thread from being put to
  sleep.

22/08/02 (PR#3687) (PR#3754) (change list 54215)
  matrix array pointers where not set to null when not used, in function
  RpHAnimHierarchyCreate
  release/compatibility macro to call function((param)) rather than
  function(param)

22/08/02 (PR#3613) RtQuatTransformVectors now functions correctly
  when input and output arrays are coincident.

22/08/02 (PR#3753) Removed unneeded flag setting from RwMatrixTransform.

21/08/02 RpPrtAdv, FxPack : user guide checked in

21/08/02 RtAnim: new API function:
  RtAnimAnimationGetNumNodes returns the number of animation nodes
  compatible with an RtAnimAnimation.

21/08/02 (PR#3736) DMorph:
  - A tolerance is now used when deciding which vertices are deltas
  since during modelling, small errors can often be introduced between base
  and target vertices that are intended to be identical. In such cases,
  this fix will reduce data size, and increase animation update efficiency.

20/08/02 Skeleton - RsSelectDevice
  Made a minor modification to the order of events in the skeleton startup.
  As a result RsSelectDevice is now called in a state where the applications
  plugins have not been attached. This is part of the fix for PR#3739

20/08/02 Maestro/Rt2d/Rt2dAnim :  Multiple changes
    Rt2dAnimOpen must be called before using rt2danim functionality, including
    playing Maestro animations.
    Rt2dAnimClose must be called on shutdown.
    API functions Rt2dShapeGetNewPath and Rt2dShapeGetNewBrush have been
    removed. Rt2dPathCreate() and Rt2dBrushCreate() should be used instead.
    Maestro animations and static 2d streamed objects must be reexported.

16/08/02 (PR#3732) GCN Fixed crash bug when calling RwEngineStop.

16/08/02 RpSkin : Change list 53582.
  Updated docs and Userguide to include skin split.
  Added new API RpSkinIsSplit.

15/08/02 RpPTank - rpPDS - SKY2 - Cloning Pipelines : Changelist 53529
  cStack was not correcly accessed in RpPDS_G3x_ADLCloneRender
  changed FAVORITEORGANISATIONMODE to FLAGARRAY
  Added platform specific (SKY2) flags : rpPTANKSKYFLAGUSECLONEPIPELINE
  Added cloning utility functions :
  RpPTankAtomicSkyCloneSetReferenceAtomic
  RpPTankAtomicSkyCloneGetReferenceAtomic
  RpPTankAtomicSkyCloneSetAmbientLight
  RpPTankAtomicSkyCloneGetAmbientLight
  RpPTankAtomicSkyCloneSetDirectionalLight
  RpPTankAtomicSkyCloneGetDirectionalLight

15/08/02 RpPrtStd : Changelist 53513.
  Added ref counting to RpPrtStd.
  Added API, RpAtomicIsParticleEmitter.

15/08/02 (PR#3380) GCN Display list generation now asserts if the number of
  indices is greater or equal to 0xFFFF.

15/08/02 (PR#3712) GCN RwGameCubeGetXFBs optimisation bug fixed.

14/08/02 RtAnimInterpolatorAddAnimTime (and SubAnimTime) optimizations
  Previously the interpolator cached the current pairs of key frames to be
  interpolated, but it now just caches pointers to the keyframes within the
  animation. This was found to be more efficient on all platforms, especially
  for high density keyframe data. The rtANIMGETINERPFRAME1 and
  rtANIMGETINTERPFRAME2 macros are now no longer available as the cached
  arrays no longer exist. Instead, a distinction is now made between
  the keyframes in the animation which have an RtAnimKeyFrameHeader and
  the interpolated frames in the interpolator which have an
  RtAnimInterpFrameHeader. This header contains pointers to the current
  keyframe pair.

14/08/02 PS2 build machine
  Now builds against sce 2.5.5

13/08/02 (PR#3696) Xbox Bump Mapping effect changed to get similar results to
  the other platforms. Changelist #53285.

13/08/02 RpSkin
  Changed an assert to allow the setting of NULL hierarchies on a skin. (PR#3439)

13/08/02 Build: RtPNG on NULLxxx targets, Changelist #53268.
  NULLSKY, NULLGCN and NULLXBOX builds now produce an extra CodeWarrior specific
  PNG toolkit library.

13/08/02 Rt2d : Change list 53215.
  Fixed METRIC2 bitmap fonts always using 32bit textures, even if the source
  image wasn't.

13/08/02 (PR#3660) GCN Added an assert in to the native texture dictionary
  reading code to assert on non GCN texture dictionaries.

12/08/02 RtBoneSplit & RtSkinSplit : Changelist 52570.
  Renamed RtBoneSplit to RtSkinSplit. Some functions in RpSkin were also renamed from
  bone split to skin split.

12/08/02 MatFX : Changelist #53136
  (PR#3707) Fix to change on 23/07/02 (PR#3565) that caused matfx bumpmapped objects
    to fail to load in the clumpviewer due to the way it handles RwErrors.
  (PR#3698) If multiple materials share the same bumped version of a texture
    this was generated for every material and added multiple times to the
    texture dictionary. They are now generated once and picked up from the
    texture dictionary for subsequent materials.

12/08/02 RpPrtStd : Changelist 52977
  Renamed RpPrtStdGetDontStreamAll to RpPrtStdGlobalDataGetStreamEmbedded.
  Also renamed the set function.

08/08/02 rwMATRIXTYPEORTHOGONAL spelling correction
  Corrected the spelling of rwMATRIXTYPEORTHOGONAL from rwMATRIXTYPEORTHOGANAL

08/08/02 (PR#2856) GCN RwGameCubeCameraTextureFlush now takes a second
  parameter to enable the box filter on the EFB copy.

08/08/02 RpPrtStd and RpPrtAdv plugin attach naming standards: Changelist #52804.
  Changed RpParticleAdvancePluginAttach to RpPrtAdvPluginAttach.
  Changed RpParticleStandardPluginAttach to RpPrtStdPluginAttach.

08/08/02 (PR#3553) GCN Fixed infinite loop bug in dlFputs.

08/08/02 (PR#3662) GCN If the maximum number of used global lights exceeds the
  8 HW limit then all remaining global lights are ignored.

08/02/02 RpDMorphAtomicInitalize corrected to RpDMorphAtomicInitialize. Changelist #52853

08/08/02 Obselete RpStereo plugin removed

08/08/02 (build) Defaults for examples COPTIMIZE : Changelist #52839
  Modified where the defaults for COPTIMIZE are setup to ensure that all
  platforms will build optimized examples by default in release builds.

08/08/02 RpPrtStd. Change list #52783.
  Removed redundant callbacks. The particle stream callbacks are no longer used.
  Re-enabled particle batch create callback.

07/08/02 PR#3689 D3D8 team plugin vertexbuffers not released with TnL cards.
  Fixed, changelist #52774.

06/08/02 GCN - Single Weight skinning on HW.

  RpSkin & RpTeam have been updated to use HW support for single weight
  skinning. The number of active bones used by a skin must be less than or
  equal to 10 unless, RtBoneSplitAtomicSplitGeometry has been used.

  IMPORTANT:
  The pre-instance binary format has been broken for skinned geometry's.
  All pre-instanced skinned geometry's will have to be regenerated.

06/08/02 Changelist #52640 sectoredit/pvsedit
  Removed sectoredit from build process and added pvsedit

05/08/02 RpSkin, RpBoneSplit. New toolkit added to split meshes such that each
         mesh only use a fixed number of bone matrices. During rendering only
         those bones are loaded into the HW platform, not the entire hierarchy.
         Binary file version number bumped due to a change in the RpSkin
         file format.

05/08/02 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the August 2002 SDK (build number 4831).

05/08/02 (PR#3660) Reading non-native texture dictionaries. Added an assert
  to the D3D8 and Xbox versions that fails if the texture dictionary is from
  another platform: Changelist 52494.

02/08/02 OpenGL All-In-One pipelines introduced : Changelist(s) #52407/8.

01/08/02 RpAnisot : Changelist #52309
  Fixed problem with size function returning non-zero for no data written

01/08/02 PDS, PS2Manager and generic PowerPipe
  Integrated support for the new PDS (Pipeline Delivery System) on PS2. This
  system allows the selection of custom rendering pipelines on the PS2, see
  the PDS documentation for further details on the pipelines supplied. Because
  the system now contains all the default rendering pipelines as well as the
  new custom pipelines it is necessary for all PS2 applications to use PDS and
  register the pipes they require at startup, see the PS2 skeleton code for simple
  details.
  As part of this integration the PS2Manager pipeline system has been removed to
  a new toolkit called RtAltpipe. PS2Manager has been superceded by PS2All, however
  any applications written to use PS2Manager may continue to do so by attaching
  the new toolkit.
  The generic c code implementation of the default PowerPipe nodes and pipelines
  has also been removed to a separate toolkit, rtgncpip, by attaching this toolkit
  an application can continue use of the original generic c pipes if required.
  Note the softras driver still requires the use of the generic c nodes and hence
  has a link dependancy on this new toolkit.

31/07/02 RtWorldImport : Changelist #52266
  Fixed world bounding box rare bug. Fixed tight bboxes for empty sectors,
  volume is now nil.

31/07/02 Removed RpHAnimHierarchyHAnimKeyFrameAddAnimTime : Changelists #52199
                                                                        #52224
  The function RpHAnimHierarchyHAnimKeyFrameAddAnimTime has been removed.
  Use RpHAnimHierarchyAddAnimTime instead. A legacy macro has been provided.

30/07/02 LtMap toolkit (PR#3659) RtLtMapLightMapsCreate now check if a world
  got 2 tex coords set only if it encounter a world sector with flag
  rtLTMAPOBJECTLIGHTMAP set. enabling the use of emtpy world to generate
  lightmaps on non world object only (change list #52104).

26/07/02 MatFX (gcn): New single pass bumpmap and bump-env pipelines
  - The standard bump map method is now almost exactly the same as PS2 and is
    implemented completely on hardware. This is likely to be the cheapest and
    simplest option for bump mapping on GameCube. Previously bump uv offsets
    were calculated in a generic way on the CPU.
  - The method now supports compressed vertex formats, pre-instancing,
    morphing, skinning, and the UseFrameBufferAlpha option (even when the
    frame buffer does not contain an alpha channel since this is mocked up
    on the TEV).
  - Standard env mapping now also supports UseFrameBufferAlpha option, but
    the frame buffer must actually contain alpha in this case.
  - This is NOT related to the MatFX GameCube multitexturing extension which
    offers more advanced effects.

26/07/02 RwFreeList/rwENGINEINITNOFREELISTS : Changelist #51914
RwFreeList implementation was ignoring the rwENGINEINITNOFREELISTS
flag for RwEngineInit() and reserving space for internal freelist objects
anyway. Now fixed.

26/07/02 NULL target RenderWare Graphics DLL name change : Changelist #51910
  DLL-related files generated by the RWDLL=1 make option now use a different
  naming convention:
	* rwg.dll
	* rwg.lib	(import library)

25/07/02 RtWorldImport : Changelist #50725
  The Hints data structure and its get and set functions have changed to
  make room for a new hint type, there are now 'partition' hints and 'shield'
  hints. If access is made to the structures elements directly, these need
  updating.
  The new functions are RtWorldImportHintsSetGroup and
  RtWorldImportHintsGetGroup, but the old functions are still supported for
  backwards compatibility.
  Also, a new schemes has been add that work soley with hints.

24/07/02 PLCore only builds : Changelist #51720
  Added support for PLCore only builds which includes a smaller size for
  the globals, resulting in a smaller memory overhead when only using PLCore.

23/07/02 PR#3565 MatFX streaming has now been made endian safe
  This was causing problems when pre-instancing on GameCube.

23/07/02 Default PlayStation2 video mode for examples
  The default video mode for the examples on PlayStation2 has been changed
  to a high res anti-aliased mode.

22/07/02 rwRENDERSTATEALPHAPRIMITIVEBUFFER and rwRENDERSTATEFOGTABE removed.
  These render states have been completely removed from the API since
  their functionality is no longer supported on any platform.

17/07/02 RtIntel removed
  Support for the RtIntel toolkit has been removed from RenderWare. Where
  a platform can support the SIMD operations offered by RtIntel the driver
  can implement these optimisations if required.

17/07/02 OpenGL & Softras (PR#3634) PTank vertex alpha flag when FALSE
  but particle color alpha != 255 and using a texture with alpha now
  renders correctly.

16/07/02 RwFreeList implementation changed...
  ...to decrease the number of allocations needed and to allow the user
  control over RenderWare's freelist sizes to tune them for his/her game.
  This should allow for better performance and decreased memory fragmentation.
  The new API function RwFreeListCreateAndPreallocateSpace should now be
  preferred over RwFreeListCreate. See also the RwFreeList overview in the
  API reference for a list of functions used to control freelist sizes.

15/07/02 Xbox and PC (PR#3632) RwFastRealToUInt32 inline assembler functions
  changed to overwrite the default macro with the same name.

12/07/02 PS2 PTank - new pipelines which use much less CPU time are used for all
  PTanks which don't have the rpPTANKDFLAGMATRIX, rpPTANKDFLAGNORMAL or
  rpPTANKDFLAGSTRUCTURE flags set. The rpPTANKSKYFLAGDONTALLOCATE platform
  flag has been added to allow the user to supply the PTank with the required
  memory which would otherwise be allocated when the PTank is created.

11/07/02 GCN (PR#3472) Shadows were disappearing due to uninitialized matrix
  flags.

10/07/02 GCN (PR#3497) _RwGameCubeRasterExtOffset now inside extern "C" section.

10/07/02 GCN (PR#3524) RwGameCubeCameraTextureFlush now asserts if the raster
  passed was created with rwRASTERDONTALLOCATE.

05/07/02 (PR#3606) sky/gcn skeleton: error in fgets implementation
  String was not terminated with NULL when maximum characters read.

04/07/02 RpHanim now relies on rtanim to provide it's keyframing and
  interpolating schemes. Where, in previous versions, a RpHAnimHierarchy held
  the animation's current state and the hierarchical data, it now contains
  only a reference to an RtAnimInterpolator object and the hierarchical data
  (matrix arrays, hierarchy definitions, ...).
  A collection of legacy macros and typedefs are provided to ease the move to
  the new system, though direct access to member variables will need to be
  updated.
  The file formats are compatible, and there is no need to re-export data to
  fit the new system.
  See RpHanim and RtAnim API reference for more informations.

02/07/02 Added RtAnim toolkit (first part of Hanim Cut off).

02/07/02 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the July 2002 SDK
  (build number 4721).

  to overwrite the 4th-float value that could have been invalid.

25/06/02 3dsmax Exporter - Fix for procedural textures which caused an exception.

24/06/02 Protected the ptank contents when emitting wihtout updating
  - changed order destruction of ptank and its frame
  - _rpPrtStdPropTabAdd was keeping only the first and the last proptab
  - Added memory cleanup in engineclose callback

21/06/02 New tristripper added. The callbacks for this tristripper also allow for
  easier implementation of alternative tristrippers.

20/06/06 PrtStd : changed the streaming function so that it is possible to
  stream out the global data at once, or with each emitter. Modified the
  propTab functions to that intents. Added RpPrtStdGet/SetDontStreamAll flag.

20/06/02 3dsmax Exporter - Fixed a bug with palettised textures with opasity map.

18/06/02 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the June 2002 SDK (build number 4627).

18/06/02 3ds max Exporter - Fix for UV values when the UV sets were not
  used in the right order.

17/06/02 PS2: Miplevels and FSAA0 defaults
  The default value of rpSKYRENDERSTATEMAXMIPLEVELS is now 7.
  The default value of _rwSkyFSAAMode0SetVisibleWidth is now the back buffer
  width.

14/06/02 PrtStd : the particle now can completely fill a batch before creating
  a new empty batch.

14/06/02 PS2 library build env. PS2 builds against 2.5.2. Updated ps2.doc/pdf
  (top level readmes).

13/06/02 3ds max Exporter - Fix for rendered textures with alpha
  Alpha was ignored in rws file texture dictionary when the size of the
  texture was not power of 2.

13/06/02 (PR#3520) PTank : texture upload/material setting was badly handled
  forcing the pipeline to upload the texture twice.

12/06/02 NULL target RenderWare Graphics DLL generation
  If the make option RWDLL=1 is used to build the SDK for NULL targets then
  a combined DLL, called rwdll.dll, exporting the majority of the SDK functions
  is generated into a rwsdk/dll/null/[debug|release|metrics] folder.
  An import library called rwdll.lib is also created in this folder for NULL
  applications to link against to "import" the functions contained in the DLL.
  Currently, only the rtpng, rttiff, rpdpvs libraries are not compatible with
  the DLL generation.

12/06/02 RpPrtStd - eClass, pClass and the proptable are now streamed as
  platform independant data that gets realigned upon loading. Removed 4 sky
  - functions made useless by the change. o Added RpPrtStdEmitterLinkPtank
  - function and updated RpPrtStdEmitterCreatePtank accordingly. o
  - Bumped version stamp to 2.

12/06/02 (PR#3511) Maya Exporter. A problem that prevented skinned toon
  clumps from exporting correctly has been fixed.

11/06/02 (PR#3534) RtLtMap - the lightmap UV calculations have been modified
  First of all, the lightmap UV generation has been optimised
  (it was an O(n^2) operation and now is O(n), so extreme cases should
  complete much faster).
  Secondly, two 'magic numbers' have been exposed, so that worlds
  of significantly varying scales may be robustly processed by the
  lightmap generation and illumination code.
  The functions for setting these values, for which there is API
  reference documentation describing their purpose in detail, are:
    RtLtMapSetSliverAreaThreshold
    RtLtMapSetVertexWeldThreshold

11/06/02 (PR#3543) Matfx -cross platform incompatibility.
  Now, the DirectX and Xbox versions use two passes when the base texture
  has alpha, and the framebuffer alpha is disabled.
  Use "RpMatFXMaterialSetEnvMapFrameBufferAlpha" to enable multitexturing
  when the base texture has alpha.

10/06/02 Xbox (PR#3542) ptank point sprites not setting world matrix, fixed.

10/06/02 Xbox (PR#3541) RpAtomicRender resets frame in PTank, fixed.

07/06/02 3ds max - Filter Through Top-Level Biped Keys option bug fix.
  It didn't filter the keyframes on the Bip01 root node.

07/06/02 (PR#3519) The serialization code was incorrectly endianness converting
  causing loading failures on big endian machines.

06/06/02 Xbox (PR#3525) RpD3DTEXTUREOP enum is wrong. Fixed to match the D3D
  definition.

30/05/02 RpPtank : #pr3505 : Added an early out from ptank render when the
number of active particle is 0.

30/05/02 RpPtank : #pr3505 : SetMaterial was destroying the much needed mesh
  when using custom pipes. (might have affected other platforms, not only ps2)

30/05/02 RtWorldImport
  Removed RtWorldImportSetSurfaceProperties and
  RtWorldImportGetSurfaceProperties which were equivalent to the
  removed RpWorldSetSurfaceProperties and RpWorldGetSurfaceProperties.

29/05/02 Xbox - Texture dictionary format changed to read all the mip
  levels at once. Previous tex dictionaries are now incompatible.

29/05/02 Xbox - Added a Write Combining memory manager that provides the
  following benefits:
  - Reduced wasted space due to D3D allocations of 4KB blocks.
  - Reduced memory fragmentation.
  - Improved RwXboxLockDynamicVertexBuffer to never stall the CPU.
  - Immediate mode indexed primitives rendering optimised using
    RwXboxLockDynamicVertexBuffer.
  - Im3D non indexed primitives rendering optimised using BeginPush.

28/05/02  Removed '#include <windows.h>' from D3D8 and NULL public headers.

27/05/02  The following legacy API has been removed.

  RpWorldGetSurfaceProperties
  _rpWorldGetSurfaceProperties

  RpWorldSetSurfaceProperties
  _rpWorldSetSurfaceProperties

27/05/02  The following PS2 API functions have changed to accommodate the
  removal of RpSurfaceProperties from RpWorld.

  RxWorldLightingCallBack has changed from

  void RxWorldLightingCallBack(
           RwInt32 objectType,
           void *object,
           RwSurfaceProperties *surface);

  to

  void RxWorldLightingCallBack(
           RwInt32 objectType,
           void *object);


  RxPipelineNodePS2ManagerApplyLight has changed from,

  void RxPipelineNodePS2ManagerApplyLight(
           const RpLight *light,
           const RwMatrix *inverseMat,
           RwReal invScale,
           RwReal recipInvScale,
           const RwSurfaceProperties *surfaceProps);

  to

  void RxPipelineNodePS2ManagerApplyLight(
           const RpLight *light,
           const RwMatrix *inverseMat,
           RwReal invScale,
           RwReal recipInvScale);


  RxPipelineNodePS2AllApplyLight has changed from,

  void RxPipelineNodePS2AllApplyLight(
           const RpLight *light,
           const RwMatrix *inverseMat,
           RwReal invScale,
           RwReal recipInvScale,
           const RwSurfaceProperties *surfaceProps);

  to

           const RpLight *light,
           const RwMatrix *inverseMat,
           RwReal invScale,
           RwReal recipInvScale);

27/05/02  The following legacy API has been removed.

  RpGeometryGetSurfaceProperties
  _rpGeometryGetSurfaceProperties

  RpGeometrySetSurfaceProperties
  _rpGeometrySetSurfaceProperties

27/05/02 (PR#3498) Added an assert on the function _rxD3D8DefaultRenderCallback
  that checks if the material pointer is non-NULL.

27/05/02 The following legacy support macros have been removed.

27/05/02 (build) added sncommon/cwcommon folder fixes and a shared folder for
  Apireference & Tuorials .chms & .chis.

24/05/02 GCN (PR#3341) Mipmap initialisation bug.

Mip levels after the first edge to reach 1 pixel in dimension were not being
initialised due to a missing clause catching zero length edges.

e.g.
Mip Level    Width    Height
    0         64        4
    1         32        2
    2         16        1
    3          8        1    Uninitialised
    4          4        1    Uninitialised
    5          2        1    Uninitialised
    6          1        1    Uninitialised

23/05/02 (build) changed packtargs to work with new build

22/05/02 (build) changed buildtarget to identify type of build in logs

21/05/02 GCN
  Removed recipz from rwGameCube2DVertex struct.

21/05/02 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the May 2002 SDK (build number 4531).

20/05/02 D3D8 (PR#3481) Toon plugin not using world matrix for skinned models.
  Fixed.

16/05/02 Maya Exporter - A bug has been fixed that could cause an exception when
  exporting polygons with vertices not referenced by any of the triangles in
  the polygon.

15/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Skinning Rollout in Anm exporter
  is removed since these option should not effect anm file.

15/05/02 XBOX (PR#3470) - picking example fixed.

14/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Start and End Frame settings
  We had an exception if the Start frame is equal or greater then the End
  frame. Fixed. We display an error and use Start+1 for and End frame.

14/05/02 Ptank - Sky : the resEntry was used without being checked causing
  crash when the ressource Arenna was purged/freed/trashed.
  Plus instance/swapping callback where not reseted after "official"
  instancing call

14/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Load/Save Selection buttons
  Used to crash max if there were no batch nodes in the scene. Fixed now.

14/05/02 2dconvrt (PR#3463) Export of .pngs fixed

14/05/02 PTank - PrtStd : Workaround for PR#3461 : DMA Manager was causing
  Instancing time glitches.

13/05/02 RpPVS - Fixed PR#3451.
  As such, ASSERTs no longer pop up with multiple worlds at run-time.

13/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Material color modulation
  For Standard Material we were not modulating color for bitmap textures.
  Now this applies for all textures. This is because 3ds max doesn't
  modulate material color in viewports and also because default color is
  not white so textures would always look wrong. For RwMaterial we always
  modulate the color, but since it defaults to white, it's not a problem.

13/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Export Object in World Space option
  Was set by default when Add Node or Auto Create Nodes buttons
  were used, but was off when node was just switched to dff/anm
  type. Now it's always on by default.

13/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Preserve Normals option
  in material settings rollout was ignored. Removed now. So if Export
  2-Sided Materials option is turned on for all geometry that has
  2-Sided Materials, vertices and triangles will be duplicated, and
  normals flipped for right shading.

13/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Cropping for all textures in RwMaterial.
  Support for cropping in RwMaterial is added. Have in mind that cropping
  in 3ds max is per bitmap information, and in RW is per material per UV
  set information, so things will go wrong if two textures in the same
  material using the same UV set, have crop applied on one of them. We will
  put an error message in such case in Warning dialog, but continue export.
  Another thing is cropping will affect your tristripping if you use tiled
  texture. A warning for that is displayed too.
  Also Apply option in Bitmap crop settings was ignored, fixed now.

13/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Warning dialog bug fix.
  If the option Display Report was turned off, and there are some errors,
  dialog would appear, but except the icons it would be empty. Fixed now
  and dialog will appear with just errors.

10/05/02 PTANK : Capital R in front of ALL functions/typedef

10/05/02 PTANK : 2d texcoordinates where not matching all the platforms

10/05/02 PTANK : Published custom ptank creation stealth function

10/05/02 PTANK : Replace 0 check in the custom render callback by a couple of
  assert, and updated the examples accordingly

10/05/02 GCN (PR#3426) RwRasterLock when locking rasters of type
  rwRASTERTYPECAMERATEXTURE was not invalidating the pixel memory from DCache.

10/05/02 GCN (PR#3430) Loading and rendering pre-instanced skinned geometries
  would invoke the instancing code causing it to crash due to a missing flag
  check.

09/05/02 D3D8 (PR#3453) Video memory wasted on palettes.
  Now available palette numbers are used in a more efficient way.

08/05/02 (PR#3292) RwRasterGetStride now asserts if the rasters pixels have
  not been locked.

08/05/02 PS2All Im3D pipeline changes
  Prior to the DMA system changes (of 28/04/02), the largest instanced Im3D
  primitive supported on PS2 was 64k. This necessitated painfully slow
  primitive splitting behind the scenes. As this restriction no longer
  applies (the maximum instanced block allocation can now be increased
  by calling _rwDMAPreAlloc before RwEngineStart), the primitive-splitting
  code has been removed from the PS2All pipeline architecture (it still
  remains in the PS2Manager code, as its status is now 'legacy code'). This
  may result in a code size reduction and a (CPU-side) Im3D rendering
  performance increase. In addition to this, the following items have been
  removed from the API:
    o RxPipelineNodePS2AllMatIm3DPreMeshCallBack,
    o RxPipelineNodePS2AllMatIm3DPostMeshCallBack,
    o RxPipelineNodePS2AllMatIm3DMeshSplitCallBack,
    o _rwIm3DPS2AllIm3DPreMeshCallBack,
    o _rwIm3DPS2AllIm3DPostMeshCallBack,
    o _rwIm3DPS2AllMeshSplitCallBack,
    o rxPS2ALLMATCALLBACKIM3DMESHSPLIT,
    o rxPS2ALLMATCALLBACKIM3DPOSTMESH,
    o rxPS2ALLMATCALLBACKIM3DPREMESH
    o _rwIm3DPS2AllMeshEnd
  Additionally, RwIm3DPS2AllPostMeshCallBack is now only required during
  an RWMETRICS build.

07/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Start and End frame support in DFF/ANM exporter.

07/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Custom attributes fix.
  If the custom attributes were not setup right the exporter could've crash.
  Fixed now.

07/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Vertices with different normals were duplicated
  in the exporter even if the normals were not exported. That would usually
  affect the prelight colors. Fixed now.

03/05/02 RtImport and SectorEditor fixes:
  RtImport: Asserts that maxWorldSectorPolygons and maxWorldSectorSize are
  greater than zero.
  Space culling respects hints.
  SectorEditor: maxWorldSectorPolygons and maxWorldSectorSize now can't be set
  zero or below.
  PVS generation on an empty world crash fixed.

03/05/02 OpenGL RpAnisot
  Added support for anisotropic filtering to OpenGL via the extension
  GL_EXT_texture_filter_anisotropic. This affects PC and Mac implementations.
  Included rpanisot as a valid plugin to build for OpenGL in the top-level
  makefile.

03/05/02 RtImport
  GuideKDtree child order flag was set incorrectly.

02/05/02 Visualizer (PR#3384) Changed place where reg keys are stored from
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE to HKEY_CURRENT_USER to allow users without admin
  priviledges to run the visualizer.

01/05/02 D3D8 (PR#3424) resizing the windows in an example.
  Changed to restore current cached values for alpha renderstates when doing
  a device reset.

01/05/02 Binary revision number bumped to 3.4.0.00

01/05/02 OpenGL
  Extension query function _rwOpenGLIsExtensionSupported() upgraded to
  API status with a name change to RwOpenGLIsExtensionSupported() and
  documented. Structure RwGlVertex changed to RwOpenGLVertex and documented.

  Debug output upon calling RwEngineStart() has been changed to correctly
  format ALL supported extensions by the OpenGL implementation. Also, for Win
  and Mac drivers, information about the pixel format selected by the driver
  is output.

30/04/02 Xbox (PR#3419) rxXbAtomicMatFXEnvRender, prelit and material colour.
  Using pixel shaders to modulate the diffuse color by the material color
  before adding the envmap texture.

30/04/02 GCN (PR#3418) RwCameraClear did not restore fog state correctly.

  On GameCube, RwCameraClear disabled fog but did not restore the setting
  again once finished. Later calls to rwRENDERSTATEFOGENABLE had no effect
  because fog was already enabled according to the cache.

29/04/02 (PR#3411) NULL Xbox calculates incorrectly the number of mip levels,
  fixed.

29/04/02 (PR#3409) D3D8 crashes when calling RwRasterGetNumLevels for a raster
  created with rwRASTERDONTALLOCATE, fixed.

29/04/02 GCN (PR#3407)
   RwRasterGetNumLevels returns 1 to few if, a raster is created with
   rwRASTERDONTALLOCATE and then RwRasterGetNumLevels is called.

29/04/02 GCN
  Added an assert into RwGameCubeTextureSetLOD that warns about the addressing
  mode on non power of two sized textures.

29/04/02 (PR#3404) Xbox prelight with material and lights: the material colour
  was not modulating the prelight and texture correctly when lights are used.

29/04/02 3ds max Exporter - "Filter Through Top-Level Biped Keys" bug fix.
  This option didn't add keyframes from the biped root node to the rest of
  biped nodes which resulted in wrong animation. Fixed now. Also removed
  warnings if this function doesn't find all biped nodes.

28/04/02 PS2 Dma system
  The dma manager has been replaced with a more efficient version that uses
  fewer interrupts and doen't do dynamic memory allocation. If you do not
  use the dma mamnager, you need merely remove any references to "sweMaxFlips"
  from your code (now hard coded to be 0), replace references to "sweDb"
  and "tcaaDisp" with suitable members of _rwDMAFlipData, and change the
  call to _swePreAlloc to _rwDMAPreAlloc (note the argument changes) to update.
  If you do use the dma manager, for example in your own pipelines, you should
  obtain a copy of dma.pdf from support.

27/04/02 GCN
  Changed RwRasterCreate to allocate a texture of the desired depth if no
  explicit pixel format is specified. 4 & 8 bit rasters will not allocate
  a palette if not explicitly requested.

26/04/02 OpenGL public variable name change to uphold coding standards:
  * (Win32) PixelFormatDesc -> _rwOpenGLPixelFormatDesc

  identical BSPs.

24/04/02 3ds max Exporter - Add Node and Auto Create Nodes bug fix.
  In some cases when a scene was just loaded or a modifier applied, etc, these
  functions would get a validity interval from max to be [0, 0] and they would
  create a dff node even though an object is static. Fixed now.

24/04/02 RtImport - bug fix.
  If RtWorldImportCreateWorld is called without setting a scheme or terminator
  these are now set to default and subsequently set back to NULL. This fixes
  a problem that occurred when no scheme was set and the world was built more
  than once.

23/04/02 3ds max Exporter - Number of references bug fix.
  Number of references in batch exporter nodes used to increase every time

  renderable objects. This node would then fail to export.

18/04/02 Xbox - RpSkin could incorrectly scale skins when rendering with
 D3DMULTISAMPLE_4_SAMPLES_MULTISAMPLE_LINEAR and building against March XDK or
 later.  Now fixed, but requires lib to be built against April XDK.

17/04/02 Xbox - Upgraded to April XDK (Build 4432)

  rwsdk/plugin/logo/rplogo.c

15/04/02 Max Exporter
  - "Save HAnim Hierarchy" option is now turned on by default for skinned
    hierarchies.
  - Env and Bump Map values in RwMaterials are no longer limited to 1.0,
    the limit is set to 100.0

    box will be displayed and a dff node with default options will be created.
  - Exporter would in some cases try to export to rws file even if there are
    batch exporter nodes used before rws was introduced. Fixed.

15/04/02 PS2 Sony libs update
  Now building against 2.5 to enable DTV480p support.

15/04/02 Max Exporter
  - "Scale By" factor in bsp options was ignored when size of the world was

12/04/02 GCN RpCrowd: (PR#3345) fixed a problem with negative UVs in crowd
  quads.

12/04/02 Max Exporter - named selection sets for edges should be prefixed with
  "silhouette_" or "crease_" and appropriate type of ink will be set.

12/04/02 Visualizer control panel cpu usage
  Reduced the cpu usage when the visualizer control panel is idling. This should
  make other applications more responsive whilst the visualizer is running.

12/04/02 Maya Exporter - Extended Support for toon shader.
  Maya edge selection sets are supported and ink with the name of the maya set
  will be set for those edges. Selection set names have to be prefixed with
  "silhouette_" or "crease_" and appropriate type of ink will be set.
  Maya blind data is used for setting the weights for the toon shader on
  vertices.
  Blind Data template has to be named "RpToon", vertex for association type,
  double for data type and "VertexThickness" should be the long attribute name.
  Values should be in 0.0 to 1.0 range.
  RwMaterial is extended with the paint name. The name from the batch exporter
  node settings will be used if the option is not enabled.

12/04/02 Ptank plugin - Spr2dgen particles was twice as big as it should be

  Fixed a problem where the clip planes would be incorrectly set after resizing
  a PC viewer window.

10/04/02 Visualizer Viewer
  Fixed a problem where texture dictionaries were freed up before the assets
  which potentially use them. If new textures were created and added to the
  dictionary during loading it would cause crashes on exit of the viewer. This
  was known to happen for bump maps exported from Maya.

10/04/02 Visualizer Viewer
  Unified the world and atomic rendering of tristrips, meshes etc. This reduces
  code space overhead in the viewer.

10/04/02 Updated the Glossary pdf from Glossary doc (they were out of step)

10/04/02 PS2: Codewarrior problem with Renderware (PR#3300)
  Use only the local extent RWFORCEENUMSIZEINT within enum definitions
  to force 4 byte enums, rather than a global extent pragma in rwcore.h.
  A pragma is unneccessary since ANSI C enums should be no wider than an int
  (see section 3.1.3.4 in ANSI C rationale). A global pragma in rwcore.h
  also applies to application as well as RW enums, which can be undesirable
  e.g. if some application files includes rwcore.h but others do not
  leading to a mismatch in enum sizes.

09/04/02 Visualizer
  Added new controls on the control panel enabling the user to set the
  sensitivity of the movement controls in the viewer.

09/04/02 Visualizer Viewer

  Automatic detection of the exporter type and the settings used for "Auto
  Create Nodes" button is now used for "Add Node" button also, so the options
  and the exporter correctly set. Again have in mind that the algorithm doesn't
  cover all export settings you might want to use.

10/03/02 Win (D3D8 and OpenGL) MCP files have been generated for examples and

  to run on GDEV. For DHH the setting in,

  GAMECUBE HW2 Dbg/Rel Settings
  Target Settings Panels
      Debugger
          GCN Debugger Setting
          Protocol

  in the IDE.

  From the menu select:

    Edit
    Preference
        IDE Preferences Panels
        General
            Source Trees

  and add RWSDK.

08/03/02 D3D8 - Changed the behavior of the texture dictionary load.
  Now it fails if a raster can not be created because the pixel format or
  the texture dimensions are not supported by the video card.
  Added a stealth function "_rwD3D8TexDictionaryEnableRasterFormatConversion"
  to enable texture conversions on the fly.

  should be:
    RWASSERT((rect->x + rect->w) <= RwRasterGetWidth(curRaster));
    RWASSERT((rect->y + rect->h) <= RwRasterGetHeight(curRaster));

14/02/02 GCN (PR#2946) Modifying positions or normal arrays now forces
  GXInvalidateVtvCache to be called keeping vertex cache coherency.

14/02/02 GCN Compressed vertex support added into RpSKin.

  IMPORTANT:
  The pre-instance binary format has been broken for skinned geometry's.
  All pre-instanced skinned geometry's will have to be regenerated.

13/02/02 3ds max exporter - Auto Create Nodes
  Fixed a problem where this would not work from the floating window interface
  to the batch exporter.

13/02/02 PVSCNVRT tool does not require textures for the world to be present
  The tool overloads the texture read callback so texture information is
  retained.

12/02/02 GCN (PR#2943) VIInit was not being called before all other VI
  functions.  This was causing VIGetTvFormat to return the wrong format.

  The call to VIInit has been removed from RenderWare Graphics and must be
  called by the application. See \shared\skel\gcn.c for an example of usage.

12/02/02 3ds max exporter - Parameter Wiring
  Basic support for parameter wiring in 3ds max 4 has now been added. Where a
  controller is wired to one or more other controllers, keyframes will be
  sampled from all the linked controllers.

12/02/02 (PR#2942) Maestro 2dconvrt would sometimes crash when trying to read
 a font. This was because a raster format was not specified correctly.

11/02/02 GCN New API functions,

    RwGameCubeSetCopyClear
    RwGameCubeGetCopyClear

11/02/02 3ds max exporter bug fix
  Fixed a problem where an export would fail if no materials were assigned to an
  object. The bug was introduced with the changes to RpUserData export on
  07/02/02.

11/02/02 GCN New API functions,

    RwGameCubeRasterSetRegion
    RwGameCubeRasterGetRegion
    RwGameCubeTextureSetLOD
    RwGameCubeTextureGetLOD
    RwGameCubePreLoadEntireTexture
    RwGameCubeTextureSetPreLoaded
    RwGameCubeTextureGetPreLoaded

    Modified RwGameCubeCameraTextureFlush to return void and changed behaviour
    if a region has been assigned.

07/02/02 3ds max Exporter - Project configuration
  The 3ds max exporter has now got Hybrid build targets which replace the old
  Debug build targets, the Debug build targets are now setup for people who wish
  to develop against Debug builds of 3ds max. To use these configurations setup
  new environment variables of MAX3DEBUG_INSTALL_DIR or MAX4DEBUG_INSTALL_DIR to
  point at the location of the debug 3dsmax.exe

07/02/02 3ds max Exporter - RwMaterial properties renamed
  A number of GCN/Xbox specific settings in RwMaterials had matching names, this
  meant that they were not properly accessible through maxscript. The clashing
  names have been changed to avoid clashes, e.g on gcn settings
	effect_file -> gcn_effect_file
	texmap_texture0 -> gcn_texture0
	texmap_texture1 -> gcn_texture1 etc
  and on Xbox settings
	effect_file -> xbox_effect_file
	texmap_texture0 -> xbox_texture0
	texmap_texture1 -> xbox_texture1 etc


07/02/02 3ds max Exporter - Changes to texture processing
  The texture processing has been reworked in the exporter to allow future
  support for writing out platform independent texture dictionaries.

07/02/02 3ds max Exporter - Changes to RpUserData export
  The 3ds max exporter now supports specially formatted custom attributes
  on lights, cameras, textures, materials, geometries, vertices and polygons.
  This data is supported both in the bsp and dff exporters.
  (This functionality is not yet documented and hence not recommended for use.
   It will be fully documented by the 3.3 release)

07/02/02 Maya Exporter - Scene Settings implementation and .rws file format.
  - RenderWare Editor changes are:  1. Multiple columns and 2. resizable scroll
    list and other controls.
  - New button and menu entry "Scene Settings" will popup a window with options
    for exporting to .rws (RenderWare Scene) file and for exporting a texture
    dictionary (that feature is still in development). If "Export all nodes to
    .rws file" option is enabled, all binary data/chunks that were previously
    stored in anm, bsp, dff, dma, spl file, will end up in one rws file. "Export
    All Nodes" button will in this case export all RenderWareExport nodes to the
    rws file, and "Export Highlighted Nodes" will process only the highlighted
    nodes in the editor. In first case chunks will be ordered alphabetically
    using node names, and in second case in order in which they are displayed
    in the editor.
  - Progress bar works now on per export basis, so even if you export several
    dffs and a bsp it will go from 0 to 100 only one time.
  - RenderWareExport command now takes RenderWareExport node names for its
    arguments. You can supply as many argument (node names) as you need.
  - Some processing is now done only once when exporting multiple nodes, which
    makes export of many RenderWare nodes faster.

06/02/02 GCN (PR#2932) Cache coherency problems with matFX perturbed UVs
  for bump mapping fixed.

05/02/02 Maya Exporter - changes to RpUserData export
  The Maya exporter now exports blind data on lights, cameras, shaders
  and textures to RpUserData. Since the Maya blind data editor does
  not support these object types the data must be added through MEL
  script. The blind data section of the Maya Artist Guide describes
  how to do this.

05/02/02 Changes to RpUserData plugin
  This plugin had been been extended to support user data on RwCamera,
  RpLight, RpMaterial and RwTexture objects. The plugin has also been
  changed to prevent any data being streamed if no user data has been
  added. The plugin is still compatible with earlier data.

05/02/02 (PR#2927) Xbox skinmatx envmapping bug fixed
  Files changed:
	plugin/skin2/xbox/skinxboxmatfx.c

05/02/02 Xbox driver consolidation
Removed _rwXbRenderStateTexture and promoted _rwXbRenderStateSetTexture
to API : RwXboxRenderStateSetTexture

05/02/02 GCN Upgraded to use CodeWarrior 1.3.

04/02/02 - (PR#2917) Tons of asserts .. ASSERTPOSITIVEORTHONORMAL
Removed RWASSERTPOSITIVEORTHONORMAL() macros from
rwsdk/plugin/hanim/rphanim.c
since the assertions these make are no longer valid.
Changelist #43904

04/02/02 Xbox - Added Lazy State Cache
D3D Render state and Texture stage state are now cached in a lazy manner
(i.e. only updated when necessary). The RwRenderState caching is unchanged,
so the behaviour of RwGetRenderState is consistent with previous versions.
Users developing custom pipeline must change the following D3D calls

D3DDevice_SetRenderState -> RwXboxSetCachedRenderState
D3DDevice_GetRenderState -> RwXboxGetCachedRenderState
D3DDevice_SetTextureStageState -> RwXboxSetCachedTextureStageState
D3DDevice_GetTextureStageState -> RwXboxGetCachedTextureStageState
D3DDevice_SetTexture -> RwXboxSetCachedTexture
D3DDevice_GetTexture -> RwXboxSetCachedTexture
D3DDevice_DrawIndexedVertices -> RwXboxDrawIndexedVertices
D3DDevice_DrawIndexedVerticesUP -> RwXboxDrawIndexedVerticesUP
D3DDevice_DrawVertices -> RwXboxDrawVertices
D3DDevice_DrawVerticesUP -> RwXboxDrawVerticesUP
D3DDevice_SetRenderTarget -> RwXboxSetRenderTarget
o
For more information on the lazy state cache and the new API, please consult the
Xbox User Guide and API reference.

31/01/02 (PR#2916) D3D8 - Identical lights not recognized
  Now, each RpLight has an index to a D3D8 light, so all of them are unique and
  can share the same space without any problem. But, the current
  implementation of DirectX seems to have an internal limit in the number of
  lights created although it is a high number: 2048 lights for T&L video cards
  (don't confuse that with the maximum number of active lights).

  Also, two new functions have been added to the RWD3D8 API:
  * RpD3D8LightSetAttenuationParams
  * RpD3D8LightGetAttenuationParams
  They are very similar to the RWD3D7 ones.

  Files changed:
	driver\d3d8\d3d8device.c
	world\pipe\p2\d3d8\d3d8lights.h
	world\pipe\p2\d3d8\d3d8lights.c

	world\pipe\p2\d3d8\worlddoc.c

31/01/02 GCN prelit alpha objects - alpha is no longer affected by dynamic lights
  Previously the dynamic lights made prelit alpha objects more opaque.

31/01/02 RwXbox prelit static objects with dynamic lighting & vertex alpha
  Previously, the vertex alpha was ignored in this case, now it's used,
  and has been brought into line with the behaviour of RwD3D8.

31/01/02 PVS plugin - Header files rearranged
  pvscnvrt failed because some typedefs were misplaced - they are now placed correctly, and made
  stealth where necessary, to avoid conflicts.

31/01/02 GCN RenderWare Graphics for GameCube can now be used with SN Systems ProDG for
  Nintendo GameCube.

  rwsdk/bin/patchlibsetjmp.exe must first be run on rtpng.a if using RenderWare
  Graphics for GameCube with SN Systems ProDG for Nintendo GameCube.

  e.g.
      /* From the command line type */
      patchlibsetjmp rtpng.a

31/01/02 PVS plugin - Bug fix
  Fixed detessellator, should now work better for scene with bizarre geometry.

30/01/02 Maya Exporter - Changes UV limiting
  The UV limiting functionality in the Maya exporter has been changed to an
  algorithm with upper and lower bounds (as used in the 3ds max exporter). The
  UV limiting and shifting settings in existing export nodes will now be ignored.

30/01/02 3ds max Exporter - Fix for UV limiting
  The previous code for UV limiting was not always generating UV's within the limits
  specified. This has been fixed with a new algorithm.

30/01/02 Null driver - RwImageSetFromRaster
  The Null driver would previously crash if you pass an already locked RwRaster into
  RwImageSetFromRaster. This has been corrected.

29/01/02 3ds max Exporter - New batch exporter feature
  The 3ds max batch exporter now has a new button marked "Auto Create Nodes" which
  processes all the data in the current 3ds max scene and generates a set of batch
  export nodes for the scene.
  Note: Not all exporter options are modified for the new set of nodes (e.g.
  tristrip methods are left to the user).

28/01/02 Xbox mipmap levels
  Now a mipmapped raster can contain less mipmap levels than the maximum.
  ie. a 256x256 texture can now contain 2 mipmap levels.
  Xbox texture dictionaries will need rebuilding.

28/01/02 Maya Exporter - Dff Exporter.
  "Coordinate System" option in the dff exporter is set to "World" now by default.

28/01/02 Maya Exporter - Bsp Exporter.
  Bsp exporting was very slow at the start when initialising data in large scenes and
  working with selected objects only. Fixed now.

28/01/02 3ds max exporter skinning support
  The skinning support in 3ds max has been rewritten to be more generic. This means
  that all types of skinned objects (currently Physique, Max Skin and Bones Pro) will
  act exactly the same. A few minor behavioral changes occur because of this as listed.
  1. There is now only a single option to enable skinned exports, this enables support for
     all three types of skinning.
  2. HAnim node id's for biped objects will always use the predefined set of id's set out
     in the exporter code. Previously this only occured when Physique skins were used.
  3. Where a skinned object is within the hierarchy representing it's skeleton in 3ds max
     it is moved to the root of the exported clump. Previously except when using Physique
     an RwFrame and HAnim node were still created where it was originally located. This
     extra RwFrame and node are now removed for all types of skinning.

28/01/02 Xbox SSE optimized RwMatrixMultiply
  You should find this version much faster than the generic C version it
  it is replacing. It is also about 30% faster than the hand optimized scalar FPU
  version we use on PC, and slightly faster than the Xbox SDK's own 4x4
  matrix multiply as RwMatrixMultiply does 4x3 matrices.
  Note however that it destroys the pad values in RwMatrix which you should
  NOT have been using anyway!
  Files changed:
    rwsdk\driver\xbox\drvmodel.h

28/01/02 Maya Exporter - Renamings.
  rwTriangulate command is renamed into RenderWareTriangulate.
  RenderWareProcessScene command has the same name, but a menu entry is renamed
  into "Auto Create Nodes". Also a button in the RenderWare Editor is added.

28/01/02 Maya Exporter - New RenderWareProcessScene command
  is added. It will process the scene and automatically create all RenderWareExport
  nodes and set the settings. It doesn't cover all the options in the exporters so
  you should check the setting if you have some special needs, but it should work in
  the majority of cases. Also the same algorithm is used by the Add Node button.

25/01/02 (PR#2908) D3D8 explicitly sets srcAlpha, invSrcAlpha
  Now the default pipelines don't explicitly set the blending modes.
  Files changed:
    world\pipe\p2\d3d8\d3d8pipe.c
    world\pipe\p2\d3d8\d3d8pipe.h
    plugin\matfx\d3d8\effectPipesD3D8.c

25/01/02 Win OpenGL pixel format descriptor (PixelFormatDesc) is now globally accessible.

24/01/02 Maya Exporter - Vertices are now remapped by maya vertex index first.
  This means, even if two vertices have the same position, normals, UVs and prelights,
  if they are different in maya (have different maya vertex index)), they will be exported
  as two vertices. This will fix some bugs with skinning and morphing.

24/01/02 Maya Exporter - Two options are now turned on by default:
  "Export Blind Data" and "Disable UV shifting". The first option will not have any
  effect on the files exported if the scene doesn't have any  maya blind data templates.

23/01/02 Light and camera export from 3ds max
  Support for export of lights and cameras has been added to the 3ds max dff exporter.
  There are no new export options in the user interface. Any lights or cameras in
  the export hierarchy will be added to the clump. Both perspective and orthographic
  cameras are supported as are directional, point, spot and soft spot lights.
  Currently all cameras require manual clip planes defining, those cameras without
  manually defined clip planes will take default RenderWare clip planes.
  Soft spot lights are defined by 3ds max spot lights where the falloff angle and hotspot
  angle differ by more than 5 degrees.

23/01/02 (PR#2845) RpAtomicClone crashes with RpMorph data
  RpInterpolatorSet* was not checking the atomic's frame before calling
  RwFrameUpdateObjects.

23/01/02 Light and camera export from Maya
  Support for export of lights and cameras has been added to the Maya dff exporter.
  There are no new export options in the user interface. Any lights or cameras in
  the export hierarchy will be added to the clump. Both perspective and orthographic
  cameras are supported as are ambient, directional, point and spot lights.

22/01/02 New RpCollis API functions added
  RpCollisionGeometryQueryData() and RpCollisionGeometryDestroyData() have been
  added to mirror the existing functions RpCollisionWorldSectorQueryData() and
  RpCollisionWorldSectorDestroyData()

21/01/02 GCN upgraded to use December SDK.

18/01/02 Maya Exporter - Removal of the File->Export method of exporting.
  The File->Export methods of exporting are no longer supported and will now simply
  point you to the RenderWare Editor, accessible through the RenderWare menu.
  The RenderWare Exporter is now a command plugin and can be called from the
  custom mel script interface.

17/01/02 (PR#2881) Xbox RwRasterUnlock with rwRASTERTYPECAMERA/rwRASTERTYPEZBUFFER
   crashed because it was calling D3DResource_Release when it shouldn't have.
  Files changed:
	rwsdk\driver\xbox\xbraster.c

17/01/02 Example Documents  added to dev\doc\Examples
  Added Word documents of the RW Examples to go out to users. One document is
  "ExamplesGeneric", the other 4 are platform-specific. They are converted to pdfs.

16/01/02 Maya Exporter - Bug fixes for nurbs surfaces.
  place2dTexture node was ignored, fixed now. Also fixed a bug in destructor that could
  lead to an exception. UV coordinates were wrong if the parameterisation for the surface
  was not starting from zero. Fixed.

16/01/02 3ds max Exporter - User Interface redesign
  The user interface of the 3ds max exporter has been redesigned to ease use of the
  batch export functionality of the exporter. The batch exporter now supports all
  export types (previously spline export was excluded). The interface can now be
  used as a floating dialog under 3ds max 4 accessible through a new RenderWare
  menu bar. The export settings dialogs have been reorganised into categorized groups
  set out in 3ds max style rollup windows.
  The methods of exporting through the File->Export interface are no longer supported
  and will now simply point you to the batch exporter.
  The chm based online help has also been removed with tooltips replacing the context
  sensitive help and a link to the RenderWare Artist Guide for 3ds max provided in the
  RenderWare menu.

15/01/02 Maya Exporter - command line batch export.
  RenderWareBatch mel function has been split into two functions:
  RenderWareNodeExport and RenderWareBatchExport.
  The first one takes one argument which can be:
  "-h" - export highlighted (selected in RenderWare Editor) RenderWareExport nodes,
  "-s" - export selected RenderWareExport nodes,
  "-a" - export all RenderWareExport nodes,
  The second function "RenderWareBatchExport" will load all maya scenes from a
  specified folder and export all RenderWareExport nodes from each scene. It takes
  two arguments. The first one is a boolean value specifying recursion and the second
  one is a path of a folder containing the scenes. If it is an empty string, a dialog will
  be displayed for browsing a folder. For example to export scenes from a command
  line you can execute one of these commands:
  mayabatch -command "RenderWareBatchExport 1 \"C:/MayaScenes\""
  maya -batch -command "RenderWareBatchExport 1 \"C:/MayaScenes\""

14/01/02 GCN Modifed the token code to call GXReadDrawSync rather that installing
  a callback to allow the performance libs to work.

14/01/02 RpClump extended to contain lights and cameras. These are
  streamed as part of the clump and automatically added to (or
  removed from worlds) with the clump.
  New API: RpClumpAddLight, RpClumpRemoveLight, RpClumpGetNumLights,
  RpClumpForAllLights, RpLightGetClump and similarly for cameras.

11/01/02 (R#2872) Patch plugin is not setting prelit data correctly, fix

10/01/02 Archived Plugins and related functionality removed from the build.
  The 3.2 archived plugins and any archive plugin dependancies have been
  removed. This includes Anim, PVS310, Skin310, Prtsys, Matfx310 and
  the tool Hanimcnv.

08/01/02 Archived exporters removed from the build
  The 3.2 archived exporters (supporting 3.1 functionality) have been removed
  from the build.

08/01/02 RenderWare version number increment
  The CurrentLibraryVersion has been increased from 3.2 to 3.3 to reflect
  the 3.3 development tree.

21/12/01 3dsmax Exporter - two bug fixes
  With hidden skins and physique using max bones.

21/12/01 Maya Exporter - RenderWare menu implementation.
  RenderWare menu is added. Options included are:
  - RenderWare Editor,
  - Export All Nodes,
  - Export Maya Files From Directory,
  - Export Maya Files From Directory Recursively,
  - rwTriangulate command.

21/12/01 (PR#2849) OpenGL restarts in same application instance, fix
  Static variables were not being reinitialized causing the video selection
  dialog to display incorrect and the OpenGL camera clear function to use
  an incorrectly cached color.
  Files changed:
	driver/opengl/baintogl.c

20/12/01 Maya Exporter - Memory leaks fix
  Fixed two memory leaks using virual destructors.

20/12/01 (PR#2843) OpenGL charset output is untidy, fix
  Pixel/texel alignment needed to be adjusted.
  Files changed:
	tool/charse/chrprint.c

19/12/01 (PR#2842) OpenGL texture lost in camera SDK example fix
  This problem arose when certain conditions surrounding camera textures were
  apparent. Briefly, the texture bound to OGL would differ from that cached by
  RenderWare Graphics causing texture binding to be skipped. The fix was to
  invalidate the cached texture reference when the bound texture changed due to
  the use of camera textures.
  Files changed:
	driver/opengl/baintogl.c
	driver/opengl/barstate.c
	driver/opengl/drvfns.h

18/12/01 (PR#2841) RpWorldInstance would try and preinstance worlds that were
  already in native form. RpWorldInstance now has the same behaviour as
  RpAtomicInstance and returns TRUE if the world is already in native form.
      files changed: baworld.c

17/12/01 PS2 (PR#2840) _rpWorldSectorSkyFreeResEntry/_rpGeometrySkyFreeResEntry
  weren't checking that repEntry != NULL causing a crash if instancing was attempted
  before the worldsector/atomic was rendered.

14/12/01 Maya Exporter - rwTriangulate command
  - This new command works as the Polygons -> Triangulate maya command,
  except it will align all new edges in the best way possible for
  tri-stripping. Have in mind that for perfect tri-stripping, vertices have to
  share: normals, UVs and prelights. It works only on quads, so in ideal case
  you would do modelling in quads and use this command to turn them into
  triangles before exporting.
  - rwTriangulate command should be typed in the Command Line and alternatively
  you can, before pressing the Enter key, drag the text to the shelf to create an icon.
  - Command works with multiple selections of objects or polygons.
  - If you get a warning: "// Warning: line 1: polyFlipEdge: Cannot flip edge xxxx,
  contained by a concave quad //" it is because of the polyFlipEdge maya bug.
  It should not hit more then 5% of edges that actually need to be flipped
  (much less then the whole number of object edges), so even if this occurs,
  the tri-stripping will still significantly improve. This is reported to the A|W and
  hopefully will be fixed in the next main or intermediate (dot) release.

14/12/01 PS2 World View
  Added toggle for tristrip clipper to menu.

13/12/01 3dsmax Exporter - Vertex Color
  Added support for vertex color (prelight) alpha and illumination values.
  Material self-illumination values are still baked into the prelight colors.
  Vertex color alpha and illumination values are a max4.0 feature.

13/12/01 3ds max Exporter - BSP batch exports
  Fixed a problem where selections were being ignored and the whole scene
  was always being exported.

12/12/01 Maya Exporter - Multiple UV sets bug fix
  A workaround has been added for a maya bug which could cause multiple
  UV sets to be ignored and all textures would just use the first UV set. The
  workaround was possible only in maya4.0 not maya3.0

12/12/01 PS2 (PR#2827) RwUInt64, RwInt64 and ProDG
  RwUInt64 and RWInt64 where not correctly defined when using SN's port of
  the 2.95.3 compiler.

11/12/01 GCN - Display list creation was over allocating by 64 bytes.

11/12/01 D3D8 - Added a faster SSE version of the Skin plugin. If the
  compiler doesn't support inline SSE assembler you can specify NOSSEASM
  to disable it.

10/12/01 Bin Tools. A subset of the the original bin tools from
  rwsdk\bin exist in the source deliverable. The majority have been
  removed for size and other reasons. These bin tools are available as
  as a zip download if required.

10/12/01 PS2 (PR#2809) - the maximum number of mip levels was not being
  correctly set when reading textures from a texture dictionary, causing
  image corruption. Files updated:
      dev\rwsdk\driver\sky2\basky.c

05/12/01 Maya Exporter - Nurbs material fix
  A bug has been fixed that could cause an exception during dff exports of
  hierarchies containing a mixture of polygon and nurbs shapes which
  share a material with no textures.

05/12/01 Compressed texture attributes in RwTexture to take up 1/3 the space.

05/12/01 Maya Exporter - Progress Bar
  The Maya 4.0 exporter now updates the global Maya progress bar. As well as
  providing feedback this allows exports to be aborted using the escape key.
