         RenderWare Graphics Example (PlayStation 2): Alpha-sorting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

The ALPHASRT example illustrates how a series of transparent atomics can
be sorted to ensure they are rendered in the correct order.

The method involves overriding each atomic's render callback in order to 
defer the rendering of transparent atomics. All atomics with alpha 
components are then rendered last, in back-to-front order, so as to
ensure correct rendering of the transparency.

An atomic is determined to be transparent if some degree of transparency
(alpha values not at their maximum value) is found in any of the 
following:

  (A) Prelight colors in the atomic's geometry.

  (B) Material colors in the atomic's geometry.

  (C) Pixel (or palette) colors in the material's texture.

On application startup, a list is created which contains all atomics
that are found to be transparent. This list is then used every frame
to determine another list that contains the transparent atomics sorted
with respect to distance from the camera. The 'position' of an atomic
is taken to mean the location of the atomic's bounding-sphere center. 

For this example a single clump is used which contains both transparent
atomics (six textured cones and a sphere) and non-transparent atomics
(three cylinders, all un-textured). The transparent atomics are colored 
red (R), green (G), blue (B), cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and 
white (W). The opaque atomics are all colored white. Note that each 
transparent atomic uses only a single material whose color is used for 
identification purposes.

For the R, G and B atomics, the transparency comes from the texture alpha
(the material colors are fully opaque). For the C, M and Y atomics the 
transparency comes from the material alpha (the textures are all fully
opaque). The W atomic is un-textured and derives its transparency from
its material color.

The order in which the transparent atomics are rendered, both with and 
without alpha sorting, is indicated in the top right-hand corner of the
display.

GENERAL CONTROLS

LEFT ANALOG stick       - Rotate the clump.

RIGHT ANALOG stick      - Translate the camera to and from the clump.

SELECT button           - Toggle menu/help/plain mode.

START + SELECT          - Quit the application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MENU OPTIONS

ALPHA SORTING           - Toggles the sorting of alpha atomics 
                          before rendering.

SPIN                    - Toggles the spinning of the clump. 
                          When enabled, left analog stick input is 
                          accumulated to generate spin. When disabled 
                          rotation is based relative to left analog 
                          stick.
                          
FPS                     - Allows the user to read the number of frames 
                          being rendered per second (updated every second).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MENU CONTROLS

DPAD UP and DOWN        - Select menu item.

DPAD LEFT and RIGHT     - Modify menu item value or execute associated 
                          command.

LEFT ANALOG stick       - Modify floating point value (if applicable) 
                          otherwise do what you would do in general 
                          controls.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
HELP CONTROLS

DPAD UP and DOWN        - Scroll a line at a time (autorepeat available).

LEFT SHOULDER #1 and #2 - Scroll a page at a time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
VIDEO MODE SELECTION

The command-line option '-vms' can be used to enable a simple video 
selection screen, which appears before the application starts running. 
Use the UP and DOWN DPAD buttons to highlight the required video
mode and press START to make the selection. Note there are several pages
of video modes; use the LEFT SHOULDER buttons to move from page to page.
