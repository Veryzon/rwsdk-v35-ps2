         RenderWare Graphics Example (PlayStation 2): H-anim delta
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

The HANIM2 example illustrates how the RpHAnim plugin can be used to 
perform delta animation. To perform delta animations you load in the
base and delta clumps, extracting the hierarchies of their skinned atomics,
and load the base and delta animations. The base animation is a figure
running on the spot, the delta animation is the same figure but only its
head is turning. The base animation is attached to the base hierarchy and
the delta animation is attached to the delta hierarchy.

A third hierarchy (OutHierarchy) is created to store the result of
adding the base and delta hierarchies together. This third hierarchy is
then attached to one of the loaded clumps' skinned atomics (it does not
matter which one). The chosen atomics will be the ones that are rendered.

To update the running animations the amount of time to update the
animations is added to the base and delta hierarchies. Then the base and
delta hierarchies are added together storing the result in OutHierarchy.
The result of adding the two hierarchies is a figure running on the spot
turning its head at the same time.

This example behaves slightly differently from the behavior described 
above, the delta animation and one of the clumps are reloaded. This is 
because the example allows the user to switch to rendering only the base 
animation, only the delta animation or the result of adding the two 
together. These differences are highlighted in the source code 
comments.
