             RenderWare Graphics Example (PlayStation 2): Imshadow
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

This example demonstrates parallel-projection shadow rendering using 3D 
immediate mode.

A shadow camera is tracked along with the running character, and a
preview of its raster may be seen at the upper right hand corner
of the display.

Every frame, the shadow raster is used as a texture and projected onto
an array of 3D immediate mode triangles based on the world geometry
which are then rendered using a suitable blending mode to produce the
shadow.

The set of immediate mode triangles is limited by a collision
test around the character and further elimination of any triangles
whose projected shadow UVs lie outside the range 0 to 1.

GENERAL CONTROLS

SELECT button            - Toggle menu/help/plain mode.

LEFT ANALOG stick        - Orientate observer camera.

RIGHT ANALOG stick       - Move observer camera forwards, backwards, left
                           and right.

START + SELECT           - Quit the application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MENU OPTIONS

FPS                     - Allows the user to read the number of frames per
                          second being rendered (updated every second).

Animation               - Enable/disable animation.

Animation speed         - Adjusts the animation speed, either forwards or
                          backwards in time.

Shadow                  - Enable/disable shadow.

Shadow resolution       - Sets the resolution of the shadow raster. The
                          actual resolution is two to the power of this
                          value.

Shadow anti-alias       - Apply anti-alias process to the shadow texture
                          by averaging 2x2 texels down to 1.

Shadow blur             - Blur the shadow texture. Values greater than 1
                          cause this process to be repeated multiple 
                          times. This may have an unacceptable impact on
                          performance.

Shadow zone radius      - Adjusts the radial extent of the shadow     
                          covered by the collision region.

Shadow strength         - Sets black or transparent shadows. This may be
                          negative to give an inverse shadow effect which
                          clearly shows all immediate mode triangles 
                          being rendered.

Shadow fade             - If set to ON, the shadow will fade to nothing
                          at the shadow zone radius, thus hiding the
                          limit of the collision zone while giving
                          a natural looking effect.

MENU CONTROLS

DPAD UP and DOWN        - Select menu item.

DPAD LEFT and RIGHT     - Modify menu item value or execute associated 
                          command.

LEFT ANALOG stick       - Modify floating point value (if applicable) 
                          otherwise do what you would do in general 
                          controls.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
HELP CONTROLS

DPAD UP and DOWN         - Scroll a line at a time (autorepeat available).

LEFT SHOULDER #1 and #2  - Scroll a page at a time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
VIDEO MODE SELECTION

The command-line option '-vms' can be used to enable a simple video 
selection screen, which appears before the application starts running. 
Use the UP and DOWN DPAD buttons to highlight the required video
mode and press START to make the selection. Note there are several pages
of video modes; use the LEFT SHOULDER buttons to move from page to page.
