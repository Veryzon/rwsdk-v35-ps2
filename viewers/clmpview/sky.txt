     RenderWare Graphics Viewer Program (PlayStation 2): Clump viewer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

The CLMPVIEW application may be used to load and explore clumps.

On startup the viewer reads the "clmpview.ini" file and loads the files
(*.dff & *.wrl) specified there, ie this can be used as an alternative to 
command line parameter passing.

When a clump is loaded, the viewer will look for a texture dictionary
file (TXD) in the same directory as the DFF file. As there are platform
dependencies, the texture dictionary file must be identified as such,
and it is assumed that the file name includes "_d3d8" for D3D8, "_ogl"
for OpenGL, etc. So, for example, the texture dictionary file for a DFF 
called "clump.dff" running on D3D8 should be called "clump_d3d8.txd". If 
no texture dictionary file is available, textures are loaded from 
individual image files, and it is assumed the image files reside in a 
directory located with the DFF which is either named according to the 
DFF's name or is simply called "textures". Texture dictionaries can be 
saved from the viewer to a disk file using the naming convention 
described above.

The viewer now supports tristrip rendering these are the following options
under the "Render Mode" menu entry:

MESH              - If the clump is tristripped renders each mesh that
                    is a collection of tristrips and degenerates in a
                    separate color.

TRISTIPS          - Renders each tristrip in a separate color.

TRISTRIP LENGTHS  - Highlights in red any tristrips that are n
                    triangles in length. The length is set by the menu
                    option "Tristrip length".
                    e.g. if the length is 5 all strips with 5 triangles
                    or less will be highlighted. You want to try and
                    eliminate the strips that are highlighted.

The Clump View document, clmpviewwrldview.pdf, can be found in 
docs\viewers in the RenderWare Graphics directory.

VIDEO MODE SELECTION

The command-line option '-vms' can be used to enable a simple video 
selection screen, which appears before the application starts running. 
Use the UP and DOWN DPAD buttons to highlight the required video
mode and press START to make the selection. Note there are several pages
of video modes; use the LEFT SHOULDER buttons to move from page to page.
